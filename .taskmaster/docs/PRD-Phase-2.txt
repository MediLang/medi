# MEDI PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE: PHASE 2 (STABILIZATION & GROWTH)
**Development Timeline: 12-18 Months**
**Last Updated:** May 11, 2025

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Phase 2 focuses on stabilizing the Medi language core, expanding its capabilities, and growing its ecosystem. With a working prototype from Phase 1, this phase will refine healthcare-specific language constructs, expand the standard library, and enhance development tools. The emphasis is on preparing Medi for real-world pilot deployments in healthcare institutions and gathering feedback from the community to inform future development.

## BUSINESS OBJECTIVES

1. Stabilize Medi's syntax and core features to minimize future breaking changes
2. Expand ecosystem with a comprehensive standard library and package registry
3. Deploy pilot projects in university/hospital settings for real-world validation
4. Build community engagement through documentation, examples, and outreach
5. Prepare technical foundation for self-hosting transition in Phase 3

## KEY USE CASES

### 1. Multi-institution Federated Analysis
**User Story:** As a clinical researcher, I want to analyze patient data across multiple institutions without sharing raw data.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 2
federated {
  participants: ["hospital_a", "hospital_b", "hospital_c"],
  privacy: differential_privacy(epsilon: 0.1),
  query: |site| {
    let diabetes_patients = site.fhir_query("Patient")
      .with("Condition", c => c.code.matches("diabetes"))
      .count();
    
    return diabetes_patients / site.patient_count();
  }
};
```

### 2. Advanced Regulatory Compliance
**User Story:** As a healthcare compliance officer, I want comprehensive regulatory checks and reporting.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 2
regulate {
  standards: ["HIPAA", "GDPR", "FDA_21CFR11"],
  data: patient_registry,
  checks: ["de_identification", "consent", "audit_trail", "data_integrity"],
  reporting: {
    format: "pdf",
    schedule: "monthly",
    recipients: ["compliance@hospital.org"]
  }
};
```

### 3. Clinical Trial Analysis
**User Story:** As a biostatistician, I want to perform comprehensive trial analyses with visualizations.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 2
let trial = clinical_trial("NCT12345678");
let km_curve = trial.survival_analysis()
  .by_arm()
  .kaplan_meier()
  .with_confidence_interval(0.95);

plot_kaplan_meier(km_curve)
  .with_risk_table()
  .with_p_value()
  .title("Overall Survival by Treatment Arm")
  .save("survival_curve.pdf");
```

### 4. Real-time Patient Monitoring
**User Story:** As a clinician, I want to monitor patients in real-time using IoT devices.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 2
let patient_monitor = iot.stream("patient_vitals")
  .filter(p => p.unit_id == "icu_42")
  .window(minutes: 5, slide: seconds: 30);

patient_monitor.alert(
  condition: vitals => vitals.heart_rate > 120 || vitals.spo2 < 92,
  action: |alert| {
    notify_care_team(alert);
    log_to_ehr(alert.patient_id, alert.measurement);
  }
);
```

### 5. Hospital Resource Optimization
**User Story:** As a hospital administrator, I want to optimize resource allocation.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 2
let admission_data = hospital.admissions(timeframe: last_year);
let bed_usage = admission_data.analyze_utilization();

let forecast = bed_usage.forecast(
  method: "lstm",
  horizon: days(30),
  features: ["day_of_week", "season", "local_events"]
);

resource_optimizer.allocate_staff(
  forecast: forecast,
  constraints: {
    max_shifts_per_nurse: 5,
    min_staff_ratio: staff_ratios.icu
  }
);
```
