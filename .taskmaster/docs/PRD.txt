# Overview  
Medi is a revolutionary programming language purpose-built for healthcare, designed to transform medical analytics with unparalleled ease, speed, and security. The language addresses critical gaps in the current healthcare technology landscape by combining the accessibility of Python and R with the performance of compiled languages like Julia, Rust, and C++, while natively supporting healthcare standards like FHIR, HL7, and DICOM.

Healthcare professionals face significant challenges with existing tools:
- Python/R are versatile but slow for big data, lack native healthcare standards, and require complex integrations
