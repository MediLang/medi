## KEY USE CASES

### 1. Clinical Data Exploration
**User Story:** As a clinician researcher, I want to query and analyze patient data using Medi's FHIR integration.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 1
let patients = fhir_query("Patient")
    .filter(p => p.age > 65 && p.condition("diabetes"))
    .limit(100);

let avg_a1c = patients.observation("hba1c").mean();
println!("Average HbA1c: {:.1}%", avg_a1c);
```

### 2. Basic Regulatory Compliance
**User Story:** As a healthcare developer, I want to ensure my analysis meets HIPAA requirements.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 1
regulate {
  standard: "HIPAA",
  data: patient_records,
  checks: ["de_identification", "minimum_necessary"]
};

let analysis = analyze(patient_records);
```

### 3. Simple Statistical Analysis
**User Story:** As a clinical researcher, I want to perform basic statistical analysis on trial data.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 1
let trial_data = load_csv("trial_results.csv");
let treatment_group = trial_data.filter(p => p.group == "treatment");
let control_group = trial_data.filter(p => p.group == "control");

let t_test = stats.t_test(treatment_group.outcome, control_group.outcome);
println!("P-value: {:.4}", t_test.p_value);
```

### 4. Synthetic Data Testing
**User Story:** As a healthcare data scientist, I want to test my algorithms with synthetic FHIR, VCF, and IoT data streams.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 1
let synthetic_patients = generate_synthetic_patients(100, {
  demographics: "realistic",
  conditions: ["diabetes", "hypertension"],
  observations: ["glucose", "blood_pressure"]
});

let analysis = run_risk_model(synthetic_patients);
```
