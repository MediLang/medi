			"taskId": 13,
			"taskTitle": "Implement REPL",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the REPL implementation into: (1) Input loop and command parsing (including history and multi-line support), (2) Incremental parsing and type checking with state preservation, (3) Runtime evaluation and pretty-printing of results/errors, (4) Session management commands (load, vars, help, quit), (5) Integration and testing for error recovery and usability.",
			"reasoning": "Implementing a robust REPL for a statically-typed language with incremental compilation, clinician-friendly error reporting, and session state is moderately complex. It requires careful design for input handling, incremental compilation, runtime integration, and user experience, but leverages established patterns from language server and REPL implementations."
