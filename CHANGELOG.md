## [Unreleased]

Planned improvements and documentation updates.

## [v0.0.4] - 2025-10-24

### Added
- Comprehensive runtime error/diagnostics system in `compiler/medic_runtime`:
  - `RuntimeError`, `MemoryErrorKind`, `SchedulerErrorKind`, and `RuntimeDiagnostic`.
  - Context-aware reporting via `set_error_reporter_with_context` and `medi_runtime_report!` capturing file/line/module/op tags.
  - Multi-listener support with `add_error_context_listener` for observability and tests.
- Context tags for channels and GC paths:
  - Channels: `channel.send`, `channel.recv`, `channel.try_recv` (on non-empty failures).
  - Crossbeam: `xchan.send`, `xchan.try_send` (on non-full failures), `xchan.recv`, `xchan.try_recv` (on non-empty failures).
  - GC: `gc.lock` emitted when GC mutex is poisoned.
- Real-time memory (rt_zones) diagnostics:
  - `rt_region.alloc_*_overflow` tags for region overflow cases.
  - `fixed_pool.alloc_exhausted`, `fixed_pool.invalid_free`, `fixed_pool.double_free`.
- Documentation: new `compiler/medic_runtime/README.md` covering errors, recovery policies, RT memory, and examples.

### Changed
- Hardened scheduler tests to be deterministic (barrier/ack-based), serialized with a test mutex to avoid global scheduler cross-talk.
- Improved scheduler responsiveness by unparking workers after enqueue and after task panics; reduced lock hold time on `stealers`.

### Fixed
- Eliminated flakiness in scheduler tests (`scheduler_smoke`, `scheduler_panic_recovery_skiptask`).
- Cleaned warnings in runtime and examples (removed unused imports/mut, replaced bare `expect` on GC locks with context-tagged reports).

### Performance
- Diagnostics path validated with `reporter_invocation_under_1ms` test (10k events bounded well under 2s total); RT-zone latency tests remain green.

## [v0.0.3] - 2025-09-30

### Added
- LLVM backend integration behind `llvm-backend` feature in `compiler/medic/` backed by `medic_codegen_llvm` using Inkwell/LLVM 15.
- Target codegen support and CI artifacts for:
  - x86-64
  - wasm32-wasi
  - riscv32 (initial RV32)
- CI matrix in `.github/workflows/ci.yml` covering fmt/lint, tests (Linux/macOS/Windows), quick bench smoke, and per-target codegen artifacts.

### Improved
- Clinician-friendly diagnostics in parser for common mistakes (e.g., `=` vs `==`, unmatched brackets, `per` operator suggestions).
- Unified lexer error tokens across streaming and chunked lexers: `TokenType::Error("Invalid token '<lexeme>'")` with optional debug logging.
- Parser recovery around early lexer error tokens with cleaner EOF handling.
- Clippy and formatting fixes across the workspace; pre-commit hooks green.

### Examples
- Minimal codegen smoke programs emitted per target in CI for inspection.

### Notes
- Requires system LLVM 15.x when enabling the `llvm-backend` feature.

## [v0.0.2] - 2025-09-02

### Added
- Comprehensive type annotation tests for `let` statements in `tests/src/let_annotations.rs`:
  - Match, mismatch, and inference scenarios
  - Healthcare-specific annotations (e.g., `PatientId`)
  - Complex nested struct annotations across `type` declarations
  - Side type-table assertions via `TypeChecker::type_table()`

- Healthcare-specific type system capabilities:
  - Core medical types: `PatientId`, `Vital`, `LabResult`, `FHIRPatient`, `Observation`, etc.
  - Type inference for local `let` bindings and expressions
  - Privacy annotations and enforcement (e.g., `PHI`, `Pseudonymized`, `Anonymized`, `Authorized`, `AuthorizedFor`)
  - Environment-driven sink/de-identification recognition (`TypeEnv::{get_sink_fn,is_deid_fn}` integration)
  - HIPAA-style privacy/data-flow checks with detailed diagnostics
  - Unit tests covering healthcare types and privacy flows (see `tests/src/hipaa.rs`)

### Changed
- Aligned tests with current checker semantics for unknown annotations: `let y: Foo;` binds `Unknown` and records it in the type table (no error).
- Minor test construction fixes to match current `medic_ast` shapes (boxed nodes and span placement) and avoid borrow conflicts when reading `TypeChecker` side tables.

## [v0.0.1] - 2025-08-26

### Added
- Core lexer and parser for Medi with healthcare-aware tokens and constructs, per `LANG_SPEC.md`.
- Unicode-aware location tracking and robust streaming/chunked lexing paths.
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation with position preservation and traversal utilities.
- Clinician-friendly error reporting with clear messages and recovery mechanisms.
- Pipeline operator planning: feature-gated design for `|>` with default-off behavior, docs, and tests.

### Changed
- Documentation updates across docs/ to reflect current syntax, testing strategy, and benchmarks.
- Parser collections migrated to feature-agnostic `NodeList<T>` where applicable (e.g., match arms, call arguments) to align with `medic_ast` type aliases.

### Fixed
- Stability and performance improvements in chunked lexer; test coverage for edge cases.
- Replaced raw `String`/`Vec` usages in parser with feature-agnostic types and constructors:
  - `IdentifierNode::from_string`/`from_str_name` used consistently to avoid `IdentifierName` mismatches across features.
  - Example code updated to construct identifiers via `from_str_name`.
