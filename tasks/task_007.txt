# Task ID: 7
# Title: Build Command-Line Interface and REPL
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the medic compiler CLI with basic options, a REPL for interactive development, and package manager foundation.
# Details:
Implement a command-line interface (CLI) for the Medi compiler (`medic`) with basic compilation options. Create a Read-Eval-Print Loop (REPL) for interactive development. Lay the foundation for a package manager (`medipack`). Implement a basic documentation generator.

Key components:
1. Compiler CLI with options for target selection, optimization level, etc.
2. Interactive REPL with healthcare data visualization
3. Package manager foundation with dependency resolution
4. Documentation generator for Medi code

Pseudo-code for CLI implementation:
```rust
struct CompilerOptions {
  input_file: String,
  output_file: Option<String>,
  target: Target,
  opt_level: OptLevel,
  // Other options
}

fn parse_cli_args() -> CompilerOptions { /* ... */ }

fn compile_file(options: &CompilerOptions) -> Result<(), CompileError> { /* ... */ }

fn run_repl() -> Result<(), ReplError> {
  loop {
    // Read input
    // Parse and evaluate
    // Print result
    // Handle special commands
  }
}

fn generate_docs(input_files: &[String], output_dir: &str) -> Result<(), DocError> { /* ... */ }
```

# Test Strategy:
Create integration tests for the CLI with various command-line options. Test the REPL with interactive sessions including healthcare data analysis. Test documentation generation with sample Medi code. Verify correct handling of compiler errors and warnings. Test package management functionality with mock packages.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Compiler Command-Line Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a robust CLI for the compiler that handles command-line arguments, file processing, and execution options
### Details:
Create a CLI that supports: 1) File input/output options, 2) Compilation flags and optimization levels, 3) Error reporting with clear messages and line numbers, 4) Verbose mode for debugging, 5) Help documentation, 6) Version information. Integrate with the compiler pipeline to process source files. Implement proper exit codes for success/failure states. Design for extensibility to add new options in future releases. Ensure cross-platform compatibility.

## 2. Develop REPL with Healthcare Data Visualization [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop with specialized features for healthcare data visualization and exploration
### Details:
Build a REPL environment that: 1) Provides immediate feedback for code snippets, 2) Supports multi-line input with syntax highlighting, 3) Implements healthcare-specific visualization commands for patient data, trends, and metrics, 4) Includes data import/export capabilities for common healthcare formats, 5) Offers context-aware autocompletion, 6) Maintains session history. Ensure visualizations are accessible and clinically relevant. Integrate with the compiler's interpreter mode for real-time execution.

## 3. Create Documentation Generator [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Implement a tool to automatically generate documentation from source code and integrate it with the CLI
### Details:
Develop a documentation generator that: 1) Extracts documentation comments from source code, 2) Generates structured documentation in multiple formats (HTML, PDF, Markdown), 3) Creates cross-references between related components, 4) Includes examples and usage patterns, 5) Documents healthcare-specific functions with clinical context. Add CLI commands to generate documentation on demand. Implement templates for consistent documentation styling. Include validation to ensure documentation completeness and accuracy.
