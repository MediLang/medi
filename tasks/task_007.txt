# Task ID: 7
# Title: Develop Standard Library: medi.compliance Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the medi.compliance module with HIPAA compliance checking primitives, data anonymization utilities, audit trail generation, and basic regulatory reporting templates.
# Details:
Implement the compliance module:
1. HIPAA compliance checking primitives
2. Data anonymization utilities following Safe Harbor method
3. Audit trail generation for data access
4. Regulatory reporting templates
5. Privacy impact analysis tools

Implementation approach:
- Implement HIPAA Safe Harbor de-identification algorithms
- Create rule-based compliance checking system
- Develop audit logging with tamper-evident design
- Implement k-anonymity and differential privacy techniques
- Create report generators for common regulatory requirements
- Design compliance verification for data processing pipelines

# Test Strategy:
1. Compliance rule validation against HIPAA requirements
2. De-identification effectiveness testing
3. Audit trail integrity verification
4. Performance impact assessment of compliance features
5. Validation against real-world compliance scenarios
6. Security testing of anonymization techniques

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement HIPAA compliance checking primitives [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop core functions to validate data handling against HIPAA requirements
### Details:
Create a library of validation functions that check for PHI identifiers, verify proper access controls, validate encryption standards compliance, and implement authorization verification. Include configurable rule sets for different HIPAA sections (Privacy Rule, Security Rule, Breach Notification).

## 2. Build data anonymization utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create comprehensive tools for de-identifying sensitive healthcare data
### Details:
Implement k-anonymity algorithms, pseudonymization functions, data masking techniques, and statistical disclosure controls. Include configurable anonymization levels and methods for different data types (text, numeric, dates, geographic).

## 3. Develop audit trail generation system [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1
### Description: Create a tamper-evident logging system for all data access and modifications
### Details:
Implement cryptographic verification of log integrity, sequential event recording, comprehensive metadata capture (who, what, when, where, why), and immutable storage mechanisms. Include query interfaces for compliance investigations.

## 4. Create regulatory reporting templates [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3
### Description: Design standardized formats for compliance reporting to regulatory bodies
### Details:
Develop configurable report templates for different regulatory requirements, data extraction and aggregation functions, scheduled report generation capabilities, and export formats (PDF, CSV, structured XML).

## 5. Implement privacy impact analysis tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.2
### Description: Build assessment framework for evaluating privacy implications of system changes
### Details:
Create data flow mapping tools, risk scoring algorithms, automated privacy threshold assessments, and mitigation recommendation engines. Include documentation generation for regulatory submissions.

## 6. Develop security validation framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 7.1, 7.3, 7.5
### Description: Build comprehensive testing system for security controls verification
### Details:
Implement automated penetration testing modules, encryption verification tools, access control validation, security configuration assessment, and vulnerability scanning integration. Include compliance-specific test suites mapped to regulatory requirements.
