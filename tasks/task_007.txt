# Task ID: 7
# Title: Privacy Framework Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the privacy-preserving analytics capabilities with differential privacy and federated learning
# Details:
Implement the privacy framework (`medi.privacy`) for secure, compliant data analysis. This includes:

1. Develop differential privacy mechanisms for healthcare data
2. Implement federated learning capabilities for multi-institution collaboration
3. Create secure computation primitives
4. Implement data anonymization utilities
5. Develop privacy budget management
6. Create audit and compliance tools

The privacy framework should enable collaborative research while maintaining strict privacy guarantees and regulatory compliance.

Example implementation:
```
// Differential privacy for patient data
func analyze_with_privacy(patients: Patient[], 
                         epsilon: Float = 0.1) -> Statistics {
  // Apply differential privacy with epsilon budget
  return differentially_private_analysis(patients, epsilon)
}

// Federated learning across institutions
func train_federated_model(model: PredictiveModel,
                          sites: FederatedSite[],
                          rounds: Int = 10) -> PredictiveModel {
  // Implement federated averaging algorithm
  // Without sharing raw patient data
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for differential privacy mechanisms
2. Test federated learning with simulated institutions
3. Verify privacy guarantees with formal analysis
4. Test anonymization utilities with healthcare datasets
5. Validate compliance with HIPAA and GDPR requirements
6. Benchmark performance impact of privacy mechanisms
7. Create attack simulations to verify security
