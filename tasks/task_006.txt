# Task ID: 6
# Title: Implement Privacy and Compliance Checking
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a privacy/compliance checking stage for HIPAA/GDPR rules in the compiler pipeline.
# Details:
Implement a privacy and compliance checking stage in the compiler pipeline that verifies code against HIPAA and GDPR rules. This should include static analysis to detect potential privacy violations and ensure proper handling of protected health information (PHI).

Key components:
1. Static analysis for PHI data flows
2. Detection of unprotected PHI usage
3. Verification of proper anonymization
4. Checking for compliance with the `regulate` construct
5. Integration with the type system's PrivacyProtected trait

Pseudo-code for compliance checking:
```rust
struct ComplianceChecker { rules: Vec<ComplianceRule> }
struct ComplianceViolation { location: SourceLocation, rule: ComplianceRule, message: String }

fn check_compliance(ast: &AST, rules: &[ComplianceRule]) -> Vec<ComplianceViolation> {
  let mut violations = Vec::new();
  // Analyze AST for compliance violations
  // Check data flows for PHI
  // Verify proper use of regulate blocks
  // Ensure anonymization before data export
  violations
}

fn verify_regulate_block(regulate_node: &AST) -> Vec<ComplianceViolation> {
  // Verify that regulate blocks properly protect data
  // Check that standards are correctly specified
  // Ensure all required checks are included
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests with various compliance scenarios. Test with code that violates HIPAA/GDPR rules to verify detection. Test with compliant code to ensure no false positives. Create test cases for each compliance rule. Validate against the HIPAA Safe Harbor Method requirements. Test the `regulate` construct with various configurations.

# Subtasks:
## 1. PHI Data Flow Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement static analysis to track the flow of Protected Health Information (PHI) throughout the codebase
### Details:
Develop a data flow analysis tool that identifies PHI data sources, tracks variable assignments, function calls, and data persistence operations. Create a graph representation of PHI data movement. Implement detection for common PHI types (names, addresses, medical record numbers, etc.). Testing approach: Create test cases with known PHI flows and verify detection accuracy. Regulatory requirements: Document HIPAA identifiers (18 types) and GDPR personal data categories being tracked.

## 2. Detection of Unprotected PHI Usage [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Build detection mechanisms for identifying instances where PHI is used without proper protection measures
### Details:
Using the data flow graph from subtask 1, implement checks for: PHI transmitted without encryption, PHI stored without access controls, PHI logged to console/files, PHI exposed in UI without masking. Create severity classification for violations. Testing approach: Develop test suite with intentional violations and verify detection. Regulatory requirements: Map each detection rule to specific HIPAA/GDPR requirements for documentation.

## 3. Verification of Proper Anonymization [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Implement verification mechanisms to ensure PHI is properly anonymized when required
### Details:
Develop checks for proper anonymization techniques: k-anonymity, differential privacy, pseudonymization. Create validators for common anonymization functions. Implement detection of re-identification risks. Testing approach: Test with various anonymization approaches and attempt re-identification attacks. Regulatory requirements: Document compliance with HIPAA Safe Harbor and GDPR Article 4 anonymization standards.

## 4. Integration with Regulate Construct [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3
### Description: Integrate privacy and compliance checking with the regulate construct to enforce policies
### Details:
Develop API for the regulate construct to access compliance checking results. Implement policy enforcement mechanisms based on detected violations. Create reporting functionality for compliance status. Build remediation suggestions for detected issues. Testing approach: Test integration points with mock regulate constructs and verify policy enforcement. Regulatory requirements: Ensure integration supports documentation generation for compliance audits.
