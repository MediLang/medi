# Task ID: 6
# Title: Command-Line Tools and REPL Environment
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the compiler, REPL, and package manager command-line tools
# Details:
Implement the command-line tools for the Medi language, including the compiler, REPL environment, and package manager. This includes:

1. Create the `medic` compiler command with appropriate options
2. Implement the interactive REPL with healthcare-aware features
3. Develop the package manager for Medi libraries
4. Create project scaffolding and initialization tools
5. Implement documentation generation utilities
6. Develop testing and benchmarking tools

The command-line interface should be intuitive for healthcare professionals with limited programming experience while providing advanced options for power users.

Example command-line interface:
```
# Compile a Medi program
medic compile program.medi --target x86_64 --optimize

# Run the REPL with FHIR server connection
medic repl --fhir-server https://hapi.fhir.org/baseR4

# Create a new Medi project
medic init clinical-trial-analysis

# Install a package
medic package install genomics-toolkit
```

The REPL should include healthcare-aware autocomplete, contextual help for medical concepts, and integrated documentation.

# Test Strategy:
1. Create integration tests for the compiler with various options
2. Test REPL functionality with interactive scripts
3. Verify package manager operations (install, update, remove)
4. Test project scaffolding with different templates
5. Validate documentation generation
6. Test cross-platform functionality
7. Create usability tests with healthcare professionals

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Compiler Command Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a command-line interface for the compiler with options for source files, output formats, optimization levels, and error reporting tailored for healthcare applications.
### Details:
Develop a robust CLI that accepts various flags and arguments, handles file paths correctly, provides meaningful error messages, and integrates with the core compiler. Include healthcare-specific validation options and HIPAA compliance checks.

## 2. Develop REPL Environment [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Create an interactive Read-Eval-Print Loop environment that allows healthcare professionals to experiment with code snippets and test language features in real-time.
### Details:
Implement command history, syntax highlighting, auto-completion for medical terminology and language constructs, and the ability to load/save sessions. Include helpful documentation access and example snippets for common healthcare algorithms.

## 3. Create Package Manager [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1
### Description: Develop a package manager for distributing and installing libraries, modules, and dependencies specific to healthcare applications.
### Details:
Implement functionality for package discovery, installation, version management, dependency resolution, and security verification. Include features for managing healthcare-specific packages like standardized medical ontologies, FHIR resources, and clinical algorithms.

## 4. Build Project Scaffolding Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.3
### Description: Create utilities to generate project templates and boilerplate code for common healthcare application types.
### Details:
Develop commands to initialize new projects with appropriate directory structures, configuration files, and starter code. Include templates for different healthcare applications like clinical decision support systems, patient data analysis tools, and medical research applications.

## 5. Implement Documentation Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.2
### Description: Create tools for generating, managing, and accessing documentation for both the language itself and user-created healthcare applications.
### Details:
Develop utilities for extracting documentation from code comments, generating API references, creating user guides, and providing contextual help. Include healthcare-specific documentation templates and integration with medical knowledge bases.

## 6. Integrate Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 6.1, 6.3
### Description: Develop command-line tools for running tests, generating test reports, and validating healthcare applications against clinical requirements and standards.
### Details:
Implement utilities for unit testing, integration testing, and compliance testing specific to healthcare applications. Include features for testing against medical datasets, validating clinical algorithms, and ensuring HIPAA compliance.
