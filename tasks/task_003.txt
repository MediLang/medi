# Task ID: 3
# Title: Memory Management System Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the hybrid memory management system with garbage collection and manual control
# Details:
Implement the memory management system for Medi that combines automatic garbage collection with optional manual control. This includes:

1. Implement low-pause garbage collection algorithm
2. Create the `scope` construct for manual memory management
3. Develop safety guarantees and verification mechanisms
4. Implement memory allocation strategies optimized for healthcare data
5. Create memory profiling and debugging tools
6. Optimize for healthcare workloads with large datasets

The memory management system should be designed to handle the unique characteristics of healthcare data, including large genomic sequences, medical images, and time-series data from medical devices.

Example implementation approach:
```
// Automatic memory management (default)
func analyze_patients(patients: PatientList) -> Statistics {
  // Memory automatically managed
  return compute_statistics(patients)
}

// Manual memory control for performance-critical sections
func process_genomic_data(data: GenomicData) -> VariantList {
  scope {
    // Manually managed memory for performance
    let buffer = allocate(1GB)
    // Process data with explicit memory control
    return identify_variants(data, buffer)
  } // buffer automatically freed at end of scope
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for garbage collection correctness
2. Develop stress tests with large healthcare datasets
3. Test memory safety guarantees under various conditions
4. Benchmark memory usage compared to Python/R/Julia
5. Verify no memory leaks in long-running healthcare analytics
6. Test manual memory management with `scope` construct
7. Create performance tests for memory-intensive healthcare operations
