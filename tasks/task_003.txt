# Task ID: 3
# Title: Build LLVM Backend Integration for Code Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the compiler backend using LLVM for efficient code generation with support for WebAssembly and initial RISC-V targets, including a basic optimization pipeline for healthcare workloads.
# Details:
Implement the LLVM backend integration:
1. AST to LLVM IR translation
2. Support for WebAssembly target generation
3. Basic RISC-V support for medical IoT devices
4. Healthcare-specific optimization passes
5. Privacy/compliance checking stage
6. Code generation for healthcare primitives

Implementation approach:
- Use LLVM 15.0+ API for IR generation
- Implement AST visitor that generates LLVM IR
- Create custom optimization passes for healthcare workloads
- Implement target-specific code generation for x86-64, ARM64, WebAssembly, and RISC-V
- Design privacy-preserving code generation patterns
- Implement intrinsics for healthcare operations
- Create HIPAA/GDPR compliance verification pass

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for IR generation
2. Integration tests with end-to-end compilation
3. Performance benchmarks against C++ equivalents
4. Cross-platform compilation tests
5. Validation of generated code against healthcare requirements
6. Security and privacy compliance tests
