# Task ID: 10
# Title: Create Documentation and Performance Benchmarks
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop comprehensive documentation for all implemented features and create performance benchmarks against Python/R for healthcare tasks.
# Details:
Create comprehensive documentation covering all implemented features of the Medi language. Develop performance benchmarks comparing Medi against Python and R for common healthcare tasks. Document the language specification, standard library API, and development tools.

Documentation components:
1. Language specification
2. Standard library API reference
3. Compiler and tools usage guide
4. Tutorial for healthcare developers
5. Example code repository

Benchmarking components:
1. Performance comparison with Python/R for statistical analysis
2. Memory usage benchmarks
3. Compilation speed measurements
4. Healthcare-specific workload benchmarks

Implementation approach:
1. Use a documentation generator for API references
2. Create markdown documentation for guides and tutorials
3. Implement benchmark suite with comparable implementations in Python/R
4. Measure and report performance metrics

Pseudo-code for benchmarking:
```rust
struct BenchmarkResult {
  language: String,
  task: String,
  execution_time_ms: f64,
  memory_usage_mb: f64,
}

fn run_benchmarks() -> Vec<BenchmarkResult> {
  let mut results = Vec::new();
  // Run Medi benchmarks
  // Run equivalent Python benchmarks
  // Run equivalent R benchmarks
  // Collect and compare results
  results
}

fn generate_benchmark_report(results: &[BenchmarkResult], output_file: &str) { /* ... */ }
```

# Test Strategy:
Verify documentation accuracy with code examples. Test documentation generator with all standard library modules. Run benchmarks on different hardware configurations. Compare benchmark results against the performance targets in the PRD. Ensure documentation covers all implemented features. Test tutorials with users unfamiliar with Medi.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Language and API Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive documentation for the Medi language syntax, features, and standard library APIs
### Details:
Implement detailed documentation covering: language syntax, control structures, data types, standard library functions, error handling, and development tools. Include code examples for each feature. Documentation should be organized in a hierarchical structure with clear navigation. Quality criteria: completeness (all features documented), clarity (understandable to beginners), accuracy (no errors), and usefulness (practical examples). Deliver as HTML/Markdown files with proper formatting, syntax highlighting, and searchable index.

## 2. Performance Benchmarking Suite [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive suite of performance benchmarks for the Medi language
### Details:
Create benchmarks measuring: computation speed, memory usage, I/O performance, concurrency handling, and statistical analysis operations. Implement automated testing framework that runs benchmarks in controlled environments with consistent hardware/software configurations. Include small, medium, and large dataset tests. Quality criteria: reproducibility, statistical validity (multiple runs with variance analysis), and comprehensive coverage of language features. Deliver as executable test suite with configuration files and logging capabilities.

## 3. Comparative Analysis with Python/R [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Conduct detailed performance and feature comparison between Medi and Python/R
### Details:
Perform side-by-side comparison of Medi vs Python vs R across: execution speed for common data science tasks, memory efficiency, code readability, feature completeness, and ecosystem integration. Create equivalent implementations of benchmark tasks in all three languages. Analyze strengths/weaknesses of each approach. Quality criteria: fairness (unbiased comparison), thoroughness (covers major use cases), and actionable insights. Deliver as detailed report with data visualizations, statistical analysis of performance differences, and recommendations for Medi improvement areas.
