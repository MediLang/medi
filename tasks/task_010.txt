# Task ID: 10
# Title: WebAssembly and Edge Device Support
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement WebAssembly compilation target and optimization for edge medical devices
# Details:
Develop WebAssembly compilation target and optimization for edge medical devices. This includes:

1. Implement WebAssembly code generation from LLVM IR
2. Create RISC-V optimization for medical IoT devices
3. Develop deployment utilities for edge devices
4. Implement streaming data processing for real-time analytics
5. Create memory and performance optimizations for resource-constrained devices
6. Develop browser runtime for WebAssembly modules

The implementation should enable Medi code to run efficiently on medical wearables, monitoring devices, and in web browsers for telemedicine applications.

Example deployment scenarios:
- ECG monitoring on wearable devices
- Real-time vital sign analysis on bedside monitors
- Interactive medical visualizations in web applications
- Telemedicine applications with local processing

Implementation approach:
```
// Compile for WebAssembly target
medic compile monitoring.medi --target wasm32 --optimize size

// Compile for RISC-V medical device
medic compile vitals_analyzer.medi --target riscv32 --device medical-monitor

// Edge-optimized code example
func analyze_ecg_stream(signal: Stream<ECGSample>) -> Stream<Arrhythmia?> {
  return signal
    .window(30.seconds)
    .filter(remove_noise)
    .detect_qrs()
    .classify_rhythm()
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for WebAssembly code generation
2. Test RISC-V compilation for target devices
3. Verify performance on resource-constrained hardware
4. Test streaming data processing with medical device data
5. Benchmark memory usage and optimization effectiveness
6. Validate browser runtime functionality
7. Test deployment process to actual medical devices
