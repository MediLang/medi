# Task ID: 10
# Title: Implement Example Use Cases and Documentation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop complete implementations of the key use cases (Clinical Data Exploration, Basic Regulatory Compliance, Simple Statistical Analysis, Synthetic Data Testing) and comprehensive documentation.
# Details:
Create example implementations and documentation:
1. Implement all key use cases from the PRD
2. Create additional example programs showcasing language features
3. Develop comprehensive documentation
4. Create tutorials for healthcare developers
5. Generate API reference for standard library

Implementation approach:
- Implement the four key use cases from the PRD in idiomatic Medi
- Create additional examples showing language features
- Write comprehensive language specification
- Develop tutorials focused on healthcare use cases
- Generate API documentation from source code
- Create getting started guides for different healthcare domains

# Test Strategy:
1. Functional testing of example programs
2. Documentation accuracy verification
3. Tutorial walkthrough testing
4. Cross-reference validation between code and documentation
5. User testing with healthcare developers
6. Validation against PRD requirements

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Key Use Case Implementations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create detailed documentation and code examples for primary use cases of the language
### Details:
Identify 5-7 key use cases for the language, develop working implementations for each, document the implementation process with explanations of design choices, and include annotated code samples that highlight important language features.

## 2. Create Additional Example Programs [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop a comprehensive set of example programs demonstrating various language features
### Details:
Create 10-15 example programs of varying complexity that showcase different aspects of the language, include comments explaining the code, ensure examples cover both basic and advanced features, and organize examples by difficulty level and feature category.

## 3. Write Comprehensive Language Specification [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a complete technical specification document for the language
### Details:
Document syntax rules, semantics, type system, built-in functions, error handling mechanisms, execution model, and implementation constraints. Include formal definitions where appropriate and cross-reference with examples.

## 4. Develop Healthcare-Focused Tutorials [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.1, 10.2
### Description: Create specialized tutorials targeting healthcare applications
### Details:
Develop 3-5 step-by-step tutorials specifically for healthcare use cases, include sample data sets, explain domain-specific considerations, address common healthcare data challenges, and provide best practices for healthcare implementations.

## 5. Generate API Reference Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Create comprehensive API reference documentation
### Details:
Document all API endpoints, functions, classes, and methods with parameter descriptions, return values, error codes, usage examples, and performance considerations. Organize in a searchable format with cross-references to the language specification.
