# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Memory Management and Runtime System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop a memory management system with Rust-like borrow checking and a runtime system supporting multi-threading for healthcare workloads.
# Details:
Implement a memory management system with Rust-like borrow checking for memory safety and concurrency. Create a runtime system that supports multi-threading for critical healthcare workloads and provides healthcare I/O primitives for standards-based data integration. Ensure the runtime has a small footprint for edge device deployments.

Key components:
1. Safe zone with basic garbage collection
2. Simplified real-time zone for IoT prototypes
3. Borrow checker for memory safety
4. Task-based parallelism with channel-based message passing
5. Error handling with Result type

Pseudo-code for memory management and runtime:
```rust
struct BorrowChecker { /* ... */ }
struct GarbageCollector { /* ... */ }
struct Task { /* ... */ }
struct Channel<T> { /* ... */ }

fn check_borrows(ast: &AST) -> Result<(), BorrowError> {
  // Implement borrow checking logic
}

fn spawn_task(function: Fn(), priority: Priority) -> Task {
  // Create and schedule a new task
}

fn create_channel<T>() -> (Sender<T>, Receiver<T>) {
  // Create a message-passing channel
}

fn collect_garbage() {
  // Perform garbage collection in the safe zone
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for memory management components. Test borrow checking with various ownership patterns. Test multi-threading with healthcare workloads. Measure memory footprint on target devices. Test error handling with various error scenarios. Verify thread safety in concurrent healthcare data processing scenarios.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Borrow Checker System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement a Rust-like borrow checker for static memory safety verification at compile time
### Details:
Implement ownership rules, lifetime tracking, and reference validation. Create an abstract syntax tree (AST) analyzer to verify borrowing rules. Develop compile-time checks for mutable/immutable borrows. Test with comprehensive test suite covering edge cases like nested borrows and partial borrows. Performance requirement: Static analysis should complete within 100ms for files under 10,000 lines of code.

## 2. Develop Garbage Collection for Safe Zone [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Implement a garbage collection system for the safe memory zone that provides automatic memory management
### Details:
Create a mark-and-sweep collector with generational optimization. Implement weak references and finalization callbacks. Develop tunable GC parameters for different workloads. Test with memory-intensive benchmarks and leak detection tools. Performance requirement: GC pauses under 10ms for heaps up to 100MB, with throughput impact less than 10%.

## 3. Design Real-Time Zone for IoT Applications [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Create a specialized memory management zone for real-time IoT applications with deterministic behavior
### Details:
Implement region-based memory allocation with compile-time size determination. Create a pool allocator for fixed-size objects. Develop static analysis tools to verify real-time constraints. Test with simulated IoT workloads and timing verification. Performance requirement: Allocation/deallocation operations must complete in constant time (O(1)) with maximum latency of 50μs.

## 4. Implement Task-Based Parallelism Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3
### Description: Develop a task-based parallelism system with work-stealing scheduler and memory isolation
### Details:
Create a work-stealing scheduler with priority support. Implement memory isolation between tasks. Develop channel-based message passing for inter-task communication. Test with parallel algorithms and concurrency stress tests. Performance requirement: Scaling efficiency of at least 80% up to 16 cores with task creation overhead under 5μs.

## 5. Implement Comprehensive Error Handling System [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4
### Description: Design and implement an error handling system that integrates with memory management and provides detailed diagnostics
### Details:
Create a typed error system with propagation mechanisms. Implement memory safety violation reporting with source code context. Develop runtime error recovery strategies. Test with fault injection and recovery scenarios. Performance requirement: Error handling overhead should not exceed 5% of total execution time, with detailed diagnostics generation under 1ms.
