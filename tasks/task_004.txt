# Task ID: 4
# Title: Implement Runtime System with Healthcare I/O Primitives
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a runtime system with basic memory management, multi-threading support for critical healthcare workloads, and healthcare I/O primitives for standards-based data integration.
# Details:
Develop the Medi runtime system:
1. Memory management system optimized for healthcare data
2. Multi-threading support for parallel healthcare workloads
3. Healthcare I/O primitives for FHIR, HL7, DICOM, etc.
4. Edge device deployment optimizations
5. Secure data handling primitives

Implementation approach:
- Implement memory management with consideration for large healthcare datasets
- Create thread-safe primitives for concurrent healthcare operations
- Develop I/O interfaces for healthcare standards (FHIR, HL7v2, DICOM)
- Optimize runtime for edge devices with limited resources
- Implement secure memory handling for PHI data
- Create runtime hooks for compliance monitoring

# Test Strategy:
1. Memory management stress tests
2. Concurrency tests for thread safety
3. I/O performance benchmarks with healthcare data
4. Edge device deployment tests
5. Security validation for PHI handling
6. Integration tests with healthcare systems
