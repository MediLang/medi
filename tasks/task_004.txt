# Task ID: 4
# Title: Healthcare Data Types and FHIR Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement native healthcare data types and FHIR support in the standard library
# Details:
Develop the core healthcare data types and FHIR integration for the Medi standard library. This includes:

1. Implement native data types for Patient, Observation, Medication, Procedure, etc.
2. Create FHIR R4 parsers and generators
3. Implement query capabilities for FHIR resources
4. Develop validation mechanisms for healthcare data
5. Create efficient storage and access patterns for healthcare data
6. Implement conversion utilities between formats

The implementation should focus on type safety, performance, and standards compliance. FHIR support should be comprehensive, covering all resource types in the R4 specification.

Example implementation:
```
// Native FHIR data types
type Patient {
  id: String,
  name: HumanName[],
  birthDate: Date?,
  gender: Gender?,
  address: Address[],
  // Other FHIR Patient fields
}

// FHIR query capabilities
func get_diabetic_patients(fhir_server: FHIRServer) -> Patient[] {
  return fhir_server.query("Patient")
    .where("Condition.code", "contains", "E11")
    .include("Condition")
    .include("Observation")
    .execute()
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for each healthcare data type
2. Test FHIR parsing with sample resources from HL7
3. Verify FHIR generation produces valid resources
4. Test query capabilities against test FHIR servers
5. Benchmark performance with large FHIR datasets
6. Validate compliance with FHIR R4 specification
7. Test interoperability with existing FHIR implementations

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Core Healthcare Data Types [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive type definitions for essential healthcare data structures including patient demographics, clinical observations, medications, and diagnostic reports.
### Details:
Implement type-safe interfaces and classes for healthcare data with proper validation rules. Include support for coded values (LOINC, SNOMED CT, etc.), units of measure, and temporal data. Ensure extensibility for future healthcare data types.

## 2. Implement FHIR R4 Parser [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1
### Description: Develop a robust parser for FHIR R4 resources that can accurately convert between JSON/XML FHIR formats and the internal data types.
### Details:
Create bidirectional mapping between FHIR resources and internal data models. Handle FHIR extensions, references, and contained resources correctly. Implement error handling for malformed FHIR data with detailed error reporting.

## 3. Build FHIR Query Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.2
### Description: Implement search and query functionality that supports FHIR REST API parameters and operations.
### Details:
Support standard FHIR search parameters including string, token, reference, date, and number. Implement chained parameters, modifiers, and includes. Ensure query performance optimization with appropriate indexing strategies.

## 4. Create Validation Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2
### Description: Develop validation tools to ensure data integrity and compliance with FHIR specifications and profiles.
### Details:
Implement structural validation against FHIR schemas. Support FHIR profiles and implementation guides validation. Create custom validation rules for business logic. Generate comprehensive validation reports for identified issues.

## 5. Optimize Storage Solutions [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.3
### Description: Design efficient storage strategies for healthcare data that balance performance, compliance, and accessibility.
### Details:
Implement data partitioning strategies for large datasets. Create indexing mechanisms for frequent query patterns. Support versioning of healthcare records. Ensure data retention policies compliance. Optimize for both read and write performance.

## 6. Develop Format Conversion Utilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 4.1, 4.2, 4.4
### Description: Create utilities to convert between different healthcare data formats including HL7 v2, CDA, and proprietary formats.
### Details:
Build adapters for legacy healthcare formats. Implement mapping tools between different standards. Support batch conversion operations. Preserve semantic meaning during conversions. Include logging and error handling for conversion processes.
