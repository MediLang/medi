# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Healthcare-Specific Type System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a type system with healthcare data types, type checking for healthcare operations, and type inference.
# Details:
Design and implement a type system that includes basic types (int, float, string, bool) and healthcare-specific types like `FHIRPatient`, `Observation`, etc. Implement type checking for healthcare-specific operations and type inference for improved developer experience. Add safety guarantees for patient data handling.

The type system should include:
1. Core medical types: patient_id, vital, lab_result
2. Simple trait system with MedicalRecord, PrivacyProtected traits
3. Type inference for local variables

Pseudo-code for type system:
```rust
enum Type {
  Int, Float, String, Bool,
  PatientId, Vital, LabResult,
  FHIRPatient, Observation,
  // Other healthcare types
}

trait MedicalRecord { /* ... */ }
trait PrivacyProtected { /* ... */ }

fn infer_type(ast_node: &AST, context: &TypeContext) -> Result<Type, TypeError> {
  // Implement type inference logic
}

fn check_types(ast: &AST) -> Result<(), TypeError> {
  // Implement type checking for the entire AST
  // Special handling for healthcare operations
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for type checking and inference. Test with various healthcare data types and operations. Verify type safety for patient data handling. Test edge cases like type conversions and inference in complex expressions. Ensure type errors are reported with clear, healthcare-context-aware messages.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Basic Type System Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the core type system infrastructure including primitive types, type declarations, and basic type checking mechanisms.
### Details:
Implement primitive types (string, number, boolean), type declarations syntax, type annotations, and basic type checking mechanisms. Create the TypeChecker class that will interface with the parser. Develop unit tests for each primitive type and basic type operations. Integration points: Receive AST from parser and attach type information to nodes.

## 2. Healthcare-Specific Type Definitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1
### Description: Define and implement healthcare domain-specific types such as PatientID, MedicalRecord, Diagnosis, and related type traits.
### Details:
Create healthcare-specific types (PatientID, MedicalRecord, Diagnosis, Medication, LabResult, etc.). Implement type traits for healthcare data (Identifiable, Timestamped, Auditable). Develop validation rules for each healthcare type. Test with realistic healthcare data examples. Integration points: Extend the type registry from subtask 1 with healthcare types.

## 3. Type Checking and Inference Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.1, 2.2
### Description: Implement advanced type checking and type inference algorithms for healthcare data operations and transformations.
### Details:
Implement type inference for variable declarations and expressions. Create type checking for healthcare-specific operations (e.g., patient record merging, medication interactions). Develop error reporting for type mismatches with healthcare context. Test with complex healthcare workflows. Integration points: Hook type inference into expression evaluation in the parser.

## 4. Patient Data Safety Guarantees [pending]
### Dependencies: 2.2, 2.3
### Description: Implement safety guarantees for patient data handling including privacy annotations, access control types, and data flow analysis.
### Details:
Implement privacy annotation types (PHI, Anonymized, Authorized). Create access control type checking for patient data. Develop data flow analysis to track sensitive information. Implement HIPAA compliance type checks. Test with privacy violation scenarios. Integration points: Integrate with error reporting system and provide safety verification API for the runtime.
