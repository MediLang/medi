# Task ID: 2
# Title: Develop Healthcare-Specific Type System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a type system with healthcare data types (FHIRPatient, Observation, etc.), type checking for healthcare operations, type inference, and safety guarantees for patient data handling.
# Details:
Design and implement a type system that includes:
1. Core primitive types (int, float, string, etc.)
2. Healthcare-specific types (FHIRPatient, Observation, Medication, etc.)
3. Type checking rules for healthcare operations
4. Type inference algorithm
5. Safety mechanisms for patient data handling
6. Privacy-aware type annotations

Implementation approach:
- Define type hierarchy with inheritance for healthcare types
- Implement Hindley-Milner type inference with extensions for healthcare types
- Create type checking visitors for the AST
- Design privacy/compliance type annotations (e.g., @PHI, @anonymized)
- Implement type compatibility rules for healthcare data
- Create specialized type checking for regulatory constructs

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for type checking rules
2. Tests for type inference with complex expressions
3. Validation of healthcare-specific type safety
4. Edge case testing for type compatibility
5. Tests for privacy annotations and their enforcement
6. Performance testing of type checking system
