# Task ID: 2
# Title: LLVM Integration and Code Generation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Create LLVM backend for code generation with healthcare-specific optimizations
# Details:
Implement the LLVM IR generation component that translates the Medi AST to LLVM Intermediate Representation for compilation. This includes:

1. Set up LLVM integration with the Medi compiler infrastructure
2. Implement AST visitors to generate LLVM IR
3. Create code generation for healthcare-specific operations
4. Implement basic optimization passes for healthcare data processing
5. Set up the compilation pipeline from Medi source to executable
6. Support multiple target architectures (x86-64, ARM, RISC-V)

The implementation should leverage LLVM's optimization capabilities while adding domain-specific optimizations for healthcare workloads. Focus on generating efficient code for healthcare data processing operations.

Example optimization areas:
- FHIR resource access patterns
- Genomic data processing
- Statistical functions for clinical trials
- Privacy-preserving operations

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for LLVM IR generation from Medi AST nodes
2. Develop integration tests that compile simple Medi programs
3. Implement performance tests comparing generated code against Python/R equivalents
4. Test cross-platform compilation for supported architectures
5. Verify correctness of generated code with healthcare-specific operations
6. Benchmark optimization passes with healthcare workloads
7. Create regression tests to ensure consistent performance
