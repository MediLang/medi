# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Lexer and Parser for Medi Language
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a recursive descent parser for Medi's core syntax with support for healthcare-specific constructs and AST generation.
# Details:
Create a lexer that handles UTF-8 source encoding and tokenizes Medi code with support for medical literals. Implement a recursive descent parser that can parse the core syntax including healthcare-specific constructs like `fhir_query`, `predict_risk`, and `regulate`. Generate an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) with healthcare-aware semantic analysis. Implement clinician-friendly error reporting.

Pseudo-code for parser implementation:
```rust
struct Token { type: TokenType, value: String, position: Position }
struct AST { type: NodeType, children: Vec<AST>, value: Option<Value> }

fn tokenize(source: String) -> Vec<Token> {
  // Implement lexical analysis for Medi tokens
  // Handle medical literals and healthcare-specific keywords
}

fn parse(tokens: Vec<Token>) -> Result<AST, ParseError> {
  // Implement recursive descent parser
  // Handle healthcare constructs like fhir_query, regulate, etc.
  // Build and return AST
}

fn report_error(error: ParseError) -> String {
  // Generate clinician-friendly error messages
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Create unit tests for lexer and parser components. Test with valid and invalid Medi code samples, including all healthcare-specific constructs from the PRD examples. Verify correct AST generation for each language construct. Test error reporting with various syntax errors to ensure messages are clear and clinician-friendly.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define Token Types and Structure [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Define all token types needed for the healthcare-specific language, including literals, operators, keywords, and identifiers. Create a comprehensive token structure that supports UTF-8 encoding.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- Complete enumeration of all token types
- Token structure with position tracking (line, column)
- Support for UTF-8 encoded text
- Documentation of each token type and its purpose
- Unit tests for token structure
Estimated Complexity: Medium - requires domain knowledge of healthcare terminology and careful design to ensure extensibility.

## 2. Implement Lexical Analyzer (Lexer) [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Develop the lexer component that converts input text into a stream of tokens based on the defined token types. Ensure proper handling of whitespace, comments, and special characters.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- Correctly tokenize all language constructs
- Handle whitespace and comments appropriately
- Proper position tracking for error reporting
- Support for string literals with escape sequences
- Performance optimization for large inputs
- Comprehensive test suite covering edge cases
Estimated Complexity: High - requires careful state management and performance considerations.

## 3. Implement Recursive Descent Parser [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2
### Description: Build the parser that consumes tokens from the lexer and verifies syntactic correctness according to the grammar rules. Implement recursive descent parsing techniques for healthcare-specific constructs.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- Implementation of all grammar rules
- Proper handling of operator precedence
- Support for nested expressions and statements
- Memory-efficient parsing of large documents
- Comprehensive test suite for all grammar constructs
- Documentation of parsing algorithms
Estimated Complexity: Very High - requires implementation of mutually recursive procedures and careful handling of grammar ambiguities.

## 4. Develop Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Extend the parser to generate an Abstract Syntax Tree representation of the parsed input, which will be used for further processing and evaluation.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- Well-defined AST node types for all language constructs
- Visitor pattern implementation for AST traversal
- Position information preserved in AST nodes
- Memory-efficient AST representation
- Serialization/deserialization support
- Unit tests for AST generation and traversal
Estimated Complexity: High - requires careful design of node types and efficient memory management.

## 5. Implement Clinician-Friendly Error Reporting [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3, 1.4
### Description: Create a robust error reporting system that provides clear, contextual error messages suitable for clinicians without programming background. Include suggestions for fixing common errors.
### Details:
Acceptance Criteria:
- Clear error messages with line and column information
- Context-aware error suggestions
- Categorization of errors by severity
- Recovery mechanisms to continue parsing after errors
- Visual highlighting of error locations in source
- Documentation of common errors and solutions
- User testing with clinical staff
Estimated Complexity: High - requires natural language generation and deep understanding of common user mistakes.
