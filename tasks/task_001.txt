# Task ID: 1
# Title: Implement Recursive Descent Parser for Medi Core Syntax
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a complete recursive descent parser that handles Medi's core syntax including healthcare-specific constructs and generates an AST with healthcare-aware semantic analysis.
# Details:
Create a parser module that implements:
1. Lexical analyzer for Medi tokens
2. Recursive descent parser for core language constructs
3. Support for healthcare-specific syntax (`fhir_query`, `predict_risk`, `regulate`)
4. AST generation with node types for healthcare constructs
5. Basic semantic analysis for healthcare operations
6. Error reporting system with clinician-friendly messages

Implementation approach:
- Use modern C++ (17/20) for the parser implementation
- Define token types including healthcare-specific keywords
- Implement parser combinators for complex healthcare expressions
- Create AST node hierarchy with specialized nodes for FHIR, regulatory, and statistical operations
- Implement visitor pattern for AST traversal
- Design error recovery mechanisms to improve developer experience

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for each parser component
2. Integration tests with sample Medi programs
3. Test suite covering all language constructs
4. Error handling tests with malformed inputs
5. Performance benchmarks for parsing speed
6. Validation against the example code snippets provided in the PRD

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop Lexical Analyzer [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a lexical analyzer (tokenizer) that converts input text into a stream of tokens for the parser
### Details:
Implement token types for healthcare-specific terms, identifiers, literals, operators, and keywords. Include functionality for handling whitespace, comments, and special characters. Design the tokenizer to be efficient with proper error handling for invalid characters or token patterns.

## 2. Implement Core Parser Components [in-progress]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Build the fundamental recursive descent parser structure with basic parsing functions
### Details:
Create the parser class with methods for each grammar rule. Implement core parsing functions for expressions, statements, declarations, and control structures. Design the parser to handle recursive grammar rules efficiently and maintain proper state throughout the parsing process.

## 3. Add Healthcare-Specific Syntax Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Extend the parser to handle healthcare-specific syntax and domain concepts
### Details:
Implement parsing rules for healthcare terminology, medical data structures, patient record formats, and clinical decision support syntax. Include specialized grammar for handling medical codes (ICD, CPT, SNOMED), lab values, medication dosages, and temporal medical events.

## 4. Develop Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) Generation [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Create AST node classes and integrate AST building into the parser
### Details:
Design node classes for all syntax elements. Modify parsing functions to construct and return appropriate AST nodes. Implement visitor pattern support for AST traversal. Ensure the AST accurately represents the hierarchical structure of the parsed input.

## 5. Implement Semantic Analysis [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Add semantic analysis capabilities to validate healthcare-specific rules and constraints
### Details:
Create a semantic analyzer that traverses the AST to perform type checking, scope analysis, and healthcare-specific validation rules. Implement symbol table management for tracking identifiers and their properties. Add validation for medical terminology consistency and logical healthcare constraints.

## 6. Create Error Reporting System [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.5
### Description: Develop a comprehensive error detection and reporting system
### Details:
Implement error detection at lexical, syntactic, and semantic levels. Create clear, informative error messages with line/column information. Add error recovery mechanisms to continue parsing after errors. Design a logging system for tracking and reporting multiple errors in a single parse.

## 7. Develop Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
### Description: Create a comprehensive testing framework for the parser
### Details:
Implement unit tests for lexer, parser components, and semantic analyzer. Create integration tests with healthcare-specific test cases. Develop performance tests to measure parsing efficiency. Add regression tests to prevent reintroduction of fixed bugs. Include edge case testing for error handling and recovery mechanisms.
