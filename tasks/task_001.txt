# Task ID: 1
# Title: Core Language Syntax and Parser Implementation
# Status: in-progress
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop the lexer and parser for Medi syntax with healthcare-specific constructs and type system fundamentals
# Details:
Implement a custom lexer and parser for the Medi language that supports healthcare-specific syntax. This includes:

1. Define token types for healthcare-specific keywords and operators
2. Implement lexical analysis for tokenizing Medi code
3. Create parser rules for healthcare domain-specific constructs
4. Build Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation
5. Implement basic type system with healthcare data types
6. Support for FHIR, HL7, and DICOM specific syntax

The parser should be implemented using a modern parser generator like ANTLR or a hand-crafted recursive descent parser. The grammar should follow the EBNF specification in the appendix.

Example healthcare-specific syntax to support:
```
// FHIR query example
patients = fhir_query("Patient").where(age > 65 && condition == "diabetes")

// Statistical analysis
survival = kaplan_meier(patients, start_date, end_date, event)

// Healthcare data pipeline
result = patients |> filter(has_condition("J44")) |> group_by(gender) |> count()
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for lexer token recognition with healthcare-specific tokens
2. Develop parser tests with valid and invalid Medi syntax examples
3. Test AST generation with complex healthcare queries
4. Verify type checking for healthcare data types
5. Create integration tests that parse complete Medi programs
6. Benchmark parser performance with large healthcare code samples
7. Validate error reporting and recovery mechanisms

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Lexical Analyzer (Lexer) [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a lexical analyzer to tokenize input code into meaningful tokens for the healthcare DSL.
### Details:
Create a lexer that recognizes healthcare-specific keywords, identifiers, literals, and operators. Implement token classification for medical terminology, patient data references, and clinical workflow constructs. Define regular expressions for token patterns and implement the state machine for token recognition.

## 2. Develop Recursive Descent Parser [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Implement a parser that processes tokens from the lexer and validates syntactic structure according to the language grammar.
### Details:
Create a recursive descent parser with functions for each grammar production rule. Implement parsing logic for healthcare-specific constructs like patient record access, clinical decision support rules, and medical data transformations. Handle operator precedence and associativity correctly.

## 3. Design and Generate Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Create data structures and generation logic for the Abstract Syntax Tree representation of parsed code.
### Details:
Define node types for all language constructs including healthcare-specific elements. Implement visitor pattern for AST traversal. Ensure the AST accurately captures nested relationships, control flow, and domain-specific operations like patient data queries and clinical protocols.

## 4. Implement Type System Fundamentals [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Develop the core type system to support healthcare data types and operations.
### Details:
Define primitive types and healthcare-specific complex types (Patient, Diagnosis, Medication, etc.). Implement type checking rules, type inference algorithms, and type compatibility verification. Create mechanisms for handling medical coding systems (ICD, SNOMED, etc.) as typed entities.

## 5. Develop Healthcare-Specific Syntax Support [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.4
### Description: Extend the parser to handle specialized healthcare syntax constructs and domain-specific operations.
### Details:
Implement parsing rules for clinical workflows, medical calculations, patient data queries, and healthcare interoperability standards (FHIR, HL7). Create syntax for privacy and compliance annotations, consent management, and audit trail generation.

## 6. Implement Error Handling and Recovery [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.2, 1.3
### Description: Develop robust error detection, reporting, and recovery mechanisms throughout the parser.
### Details:
Create meaningful error messages with healthcare context awareness. Implement error recovery strategies to continue parsing after errors. Design validation for healthcare-specific constraints like valid medication dosages, proper clinical terminology usage, and contextually appropriate operations.

## 7. Create Parser Testing Framework [pending]
### Dependencies: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 1.6
### Description: Develop comprehensive testing infrastructure for the parser and related components.
### Details:
Implement unit tests for lexer, parser, AST generation, and type checking. Create integration tests with healthcare-specific test cases. Develop property-based tests to verify parser correctness. Build performance benchmarks to ensure parsing efficiency with large medical datasets.
