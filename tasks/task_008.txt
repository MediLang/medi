# Task ID: 8
# Title: Visualization and Dashboard Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4, 5
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement the visualization library and interactive dashboard capabilities
# Details:
Develop the visualization module (`medi.viz`) for creating healthcare-specific visualizations and interactive dashboards. This includes:

1. Implement common healthcare chart types (survival curves, forest plots, etc.)
2. Create interactive visualization components
3. Develop dashboard layout and composition system
4. Implement data binding for real-time updates
5. Create export capabilities for reports and publications
6. Develop web deployment options

The visualization framework should be declarative and intuitive for healthcare professionals while producing publication-quality outputs.

Example implementation:
```
// Create a survival curve visualization
func plot_survival(survival: SurvivalCurve,
                  title: String = "Survival Analysis",
                  color: Color = Colors.BLUE) -> Plot {
  // Create Kaplan-Meier plot with confidence intervals
  return Plot.survival(survival)
    .with_title(title)
    .with_color(color)
    .with_confidence_intervals()
    .with_risk_table()
}

// Create an interactive dashboard
func create_patient_dashboard(patients: Patient[]) -> Dashboard {
  return Dashboard()
    .add_panel(plot_demographics(patients), position: [0, 0])
    .add_panel(plot_conditions(patients), position: [1, 0])
    .add_panel(plot_medications(patients), position: [0, 1])
    .add_panel(plot_lab_trends(patients), position: [1, 1])
    .with_filter_controls()
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for each visualization component
2. Test dashboard composition and layout
3. Verify interactive features work correctly
4. Test export to various formats (PNG, PDF, HTML)
5. Validate visualization correctness with reference images
6. Test performance with large datasets
7. Create usability tests with healthcare professionals

# Subtasks:
## 1. Healthcare Chart Implementation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop specialized chart types for healthcare data visualization including patient vitals, lab results, and treatment outcomes.
### Details:
Create reusable chart components for common healthcare metrics (blood pressure, glucose levels, BMI, etc.). Ensure charts follow clinical standards for data representation. Implement proper scaling, labeling, and color schemes appropriate for medical interpretation. Include reference ranges and critical value indicators where applicable.

## 2. Interactive Component Development [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Build interactive elements that allow users to explore healthcare data through filtering, zooming, and drill-down capabilities.
### Details:
Implement time-range selectors for longitudinal patient data. Create filtering mechanisms for demographic and clinical parameters. Develop tooltips showing detailed information on hover. Add comparison features to visualize data across different patient cohorts or time periods. Ensure all interactions are intuitive for healthcare professionals.

## 3. Dashboard Layout System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Design a flexible dashboard framework that supports various clinical use cases and screen sizes.
### Details:
Create a grid-based layout system with resizable panels. Implement templates for common healthcare scenarios (patient summary, population health, clinical trials). Support both fixed and responsive layouts for different devices. Include options for user-customizable dashboard arrangements. Design consistent header/footer components for navigation and context.

## 4. Data Binding Mechanisms [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2
### Description: Develop robust data binding capabilities to connect visualizations with healthcare data sources.
### Details:
Create adapters for common healthcare data formats (FHIR, HL7, CSV). Implement real-time data refresh capabilities for monitoring scenarios. Build data transformation utilities to normalize and prepare raw healthcare data. Develop caching mechanisms for performance optimization. Include data validation to ensure visualization accuracy.

## 5. Export and Reporting Capabilities [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4
### Description: Implement features to export visualizations and dashboards for clinical documentation and reporting.
### Details:
Create PDF export functionality with proper formatting for clinical reports. Implement image export options (PNG, JPEG, SVG) with appropriate resolution settings. Develop scheduled report generation capabilities. Add annotation features for healthcare professionals to highlight findings. Ensure exports maintain data fidelity and visual accuracy.

## 6. Web Deployment Options [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.3, 8.4, 8.5
### Description: Develop deployment strategies for integrating the visualization framework into healthcare web applications.
### Details:
Create documentation for embedding visualizations in existing healthcare portals. Implement secure iframe integration options. Develop standalone deployment configuration for dedicated dashboard applications. Create API endpoints for programmatic dashboard generation. Ensure compliance with healthcare security standards (HIPAA, GDPR) for all deployment options.
