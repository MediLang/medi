# Task ID: 8
# Title: Create Command-Line Interface and Development Tools
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop the command-line interface including the compiler (medic), REPL for interactive development, package manager foundation (medipack), and documentation generator.
# Details:
Implement development tools:
1. Compiler CLI (medic) with options for different targets and optimization levels
2. Interactive REPL for Medi development
3. Package manager foundation (medipack)
4. Documentation generator with healthcare-specific annotations
5. Build system integration

Implementation approach:
- Use modern CLI framework (e.g., clap, argparse) for command-line parsing
- Implement REPL with history, auto-completion, and healthcare data visualization
- Design package specification format for medipack
- Create documentation generator that understands healthcare annotations
- Implement build system with dependency management
- Design project templates for common healthcare applications

# Test Strategy:
1. CLI functionality tests
2. REPL interactive testing
3. Package management workflow tests
4. Documentation generation validation
5. Cross-platform testing of development tools
6. Usability testing with healthcare developers

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement compiler CLI with target options [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a command-line interface for the compiler with options to target different platforms and healthcare environments
### Details:
Create a CLI tool that accepts source files and compilation options. Implement flags for target platforms (web, mobile, embedded), optimization levels, and healthcare-specific settings like HIPAA compliance mode. Include error reporting with healthcare context-aware messages and warnings for potential compliance issues.

## 2. Build interactive REPL with healthcare features [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Create a Read-Eval-Print Loop environment with specialized features for healthcare development
### Details:
Develop an interactive shell that allows testing code snippets with immediate feedback. Include healthcare-specific features like medical terminology autocompletion, built-in test patient data, and visualization of clinical algorithms. Implement syntax highlighting and error checking with healthcare context awareness.

## 3. Establish package manager foundation [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the core package management system for distributing and consuming healthcare-specific libraries
### Details:
Design and implement a package manager that handles dependency resolution, versioning, and package distribution. Include features for verifying package integrity, compliance validation for healthcare libraries, and metadata for clinical usage domains. Support both public and private repository configurations for healthcare organizations.

## 4. Create documentation generator with healthcare annotations [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a tool to generate documentation from code with support for healthcare-specific annotations
### Details:
Build a documentation generator that extracts comments and type information from source code. Implement special annotation support for clinical relevance, compliance requirements, validation status, and evidence basis. Include features to generate both technical documentation and clinician-friendly explanations of algorithms.

## 5. Implement build system integration [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.3
### Description: Create a build system that integrates with existing healthcare development workflows
### Details:
Develop a build system that handles compilation, testing, and packaging of projects. Implement integration with common CI/CD pipelines, support for healthcare-specific testing frameworks, and automated compliance checking. Include features for generating deployment artifacts for different healthcare environments with appropriate security configurations.
