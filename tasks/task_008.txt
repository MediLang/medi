# Task ID: 8
# Title: Develop Basic IDE with Visual Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 5
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a basic IDE with visual analytics capabilities, syntax highlighting, and code completion for Medi.
# Details:
Develop a basic Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for Medi with visual analytics capabilities, support for `.mdi` file recognition, syntax highlighting, and basic code completion. Create a prototype of the visual programming interface.

Key components:
1. Text editor with syntax highlighting for Medi
2. Code completion using the type system
3. Visual analytics for healthcare data
4. Integration with the medic compiler
5. Prototype visual programming interface

Implementation approach:
1. Build on existing open-source editor frameworks
2. Implement Medi language server protocol
3. Create visualization components for healthcare data
4. Design visual programming blocks for healthcare operations

Pseudo-code for IDE components:
```typescript
class MediLanguageServer {
  // Implement Language Server Protocol
  onCompletion(document: TextDocument, position: Position): CompletionItem[] { /* ... */ }
  onHover(document: TextDocument, position: Position): Hover { /* ... */ }
  // Other LSP methods
}

class HealthcareVisualizer {
  renderPatientData(patient: FHIRPatient): SVGElement { /* ... */ }
  renderStatistics(data: StatisticalResult): SVGElement { /* ... */ }
  // Other visualization methods
}

class VisualProgrammingInterface {
  createBlock(blockType: string): Block { /* ... */ }
  connectBlocks(source: Block, target: Block): Connection { /* ... */ }
  generateCode(): string { /* ... */ }
  // Other visual programming methods
}
```

# Test Strategy:
Create UI tests for the IDE components. Test syntax highlighting with various Medi code samples. Test code completion with healthcare-specific constructs. Verify visual analytics with sample healthcare data. Test integration with the compiler. Conduct usability testing with target users (clinicians, researchers, developers).

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Text Editor with Syntax Highlighting [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a text editor component with syntax highlighting capabilities for multiple programming languages
### Details:
Implementation details: Use Monaco Editor or CodeMirror as the base editor component. Implement syntax highlighting for Python, JavaScript, and SQL at minimum. Add line numbering, bracket matching, and code folding features. User experience requirements: Ensure responsive editing with minimal lag, customizable themes (light/dark), and keyboard shortcuts for common operations. Integration points: Create a modular architecture that allows other components to access and modify editor content programmatically.

## 2. Develop Code Completion Using Type System [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Implement intelligent code completion functionality leveraging the language's type system
### Details:
Implementation details: Integrate with Language Server Protocol (LSP) for language-aware code completion. Implement type inference for dynamically typed languages. Create a suggestion display component that shows parameter hints and documentation. User experience requirements: Low-latency suggestions (under 200ms), filtering capabilities, and keyboard navigation for completion items. Integration points: Connect with the text editor component, access to project files for context-aware completion, and hooks for custom completion providers.

## 3. Create Visual Analytics for Healthcare Data [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1
### Description: Develop visualization components specifically designed for healthcare data analysis
### Details:
Implementation details: Build reusable chart components (line charts, scatter plots, heatmaps) optimized for healthcare metrics. Implement data preprocessing utilities for common healthcare data formats (FHIR, HL7). Create interactive dashboards with filtering capabilities. User experience requirements: Accessible visualizations following healthcare UI guidelines, tooltips with detailed information, and export functionality. Integration points: Data connectors to common healthcare databases, integration with the editor for custom visualization code, and APIs for extending with new visualization types.

## 4. Design Prototype Visual Programming Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 8.1, 8.2, 8.3
### Description: Create a prototype interface for visual programming that integrates with the text-based IDE
### Details:
Implementation details: Develop a node-based programming canvas using a library like D3.js or React Flow. Implement drag-and-drop functionality for code blocks and data sources. Create a bidirectional sync between visual representation and text code. User experience requirements: Intuitive connection mechanism between nodes, undo/redo functionality, and visual feedback for execution flow. Integration points: Conversion between visual representation and text code, integration with code completion system, and hooks into the healthcare visualization components.
