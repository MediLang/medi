# Task ID: 5
# Title: Statistical Functions for Clinical Research
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement healthcare-specific statistical methods for clinical trials and epidemiology
# Details:
Develop the statistical functions module (`medi.stats`) with implementations of common methods used in clinical research and epidemiology. This includes:

1. Implement survival analysis functions (Kaplan-Meier, Cox proportional hazards)
2. Create epidemiological modeling tools (SIR, SEIR models)
3. Implement clinical trial statistics (power analysis, sample size calculation)
4. Develop biostatistics functions (odds ratio, relative risk, NNT)
5. Create descriptive statistics optimized for healthcare data
6. Implement hypothesis testing for clinical research

The implementation should focus on correctness, performance, and ease of use for healthcare professionals. Functions should have healthcare-specific defaults and interpretations.

Example implementation:
```
// Kaplan-Meier survival analysis
func kaplan_meier(patients: Patient[], 
                 start_date: DateColumn,
                 end_date: DateColumn,
                 event: BoolColumn) -> SurvivalCurve {
  // Implementation of Kaplan-Meier estimator
  // Optimized for healthcare data
}

// Epidemic modeling
func sir_model(population: Population,
              beta: Float,
              gamma: Float,
              initial_infected: Int) -> EpidemicCurve {
  // Implementation of SIR model
  // With healthcare-specific parameters
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests comparing results with established statistical packages
2. Test with reference datasets from clinical literature
3. Verify correctness of statistical implementations
4. Benchmark performance against R and Python equivalents
5. Test with large healthcare datasets
6. Validate results with domain experts
7. Create integration tests with FHIR data sources
