# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Core Standard Library Modules
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement essential standard library modules including medi.data, medi.stats, medi.compliance, and medi.ai.
# Details:
Develop the core standard library modules for Medi:

1. `medi.data`:
   - FHIR resource definitions and parsers
   - Native representation of healthcare data structures
   - Querying capabilities for patient records
   - Data validation against healthcare standards

2. `medi.stats`:
   - Basic statistical functions for clinical data
   - Descriptive statistics for patient cohorts
   - Simple hypothesis testing (t-tests, etc.)
   - Foundations for clinical trial analysis

3. `medi.compliance`:
   - HIPAA compliance checking primitives
   - Data anonymization utilities
   - Audit trail generation
   - Basic regulatory reporting templates

4. `medi.ai`:
   - Interfaces for ML model integration
   - Simple risk prediction utilities
   - Foundation for federated learning

Pseudo-code for standard library implementation:
```rust
// medi.data module
struct FHIRResource { /* ... */ }
struct FHIRPatient : FHIRResource { /* ... */ }
struct FHIRObservation : FHIRResource { /* ... */ }

fn fhir_query(resource_type: &str) -> QueryBuilder { /* ... */ }
fn validate_fhir(resource: &FHIRResource) -> Result<(), ValidationError> { /* ... */ }

// medi.stats module
fn mean(values: &[f64]) -> f64 { /* ... */ }
fn t_test(group1: &[f64], group2: &[f64]) -> TTestResult { /* ... */ }

// medi.compliance module
fn check_hipaa_compliance(data: &Data, rules: &[ComplianceRule]) -> ComplianceResult { /* ... */ }
fn anonymize(data: &Data, method: AnonymizationMethod) -> AnonymizedData { /* ... */ }

// medi.ai module
fn load_model(path: &str) -> Model { /* ... */ }
fn predict_risk(patient: &FHIRPatient, model: &Model) -> RiskScore { /* ... */ }
```

# Test Strategy:
Create comprehensive unit tests for each standard library module. Test FHIR parsing and querying with real and synthetic healthcare data. Validate statistical functions against known results. Test compliance checking against HIPAA requirements. Benchmark AI model integration. Create integration tests that use multiple modules together to solve healthcare problems from the key use cases in the PRD.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Develop medi.data Module [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the medi.data module for standardized healthcare data structures and operations
### Details:
Implement core data structures for patient records, medical events, and clinical observations. Include functions for data validation, sanitization, and transformation. Create parsers for common healthcare formats (FHIR, HL7, DICOM). Develop serialization/deserialization utilities. Implement secure storage abstractions with encryption. Add comprehensive documentation with examples. Test with real and synthetic healthcare datasets, focusing on data integrity, performance with large datasets, and compliance with standards.

## 2. Develop medi.stats Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the medi.stats module for healthcare-specific statistical analysis
### Details:
Implement statistical functions for clinical trials, epidemiology, and outcomes research. Create visualization tools for medical data. Develop risk scoring and predictive modeling utilities. Add functions for population health analysis. Implement quality metrics calculations (HEDIS, STAR). Create time-series analysis for patient monitoring data. Test with benchmark datasets, validate against established statistical packages, and ensure numerical stability across diverse datasets.

## 3. Develop medi.compliance Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create the medi.compliance module for healthcare regulatory requirements
### Details:
Implement HIPAA compliance validation tools. Create audit logging mechanisms. Develop de-identification and anonymization utilities. Add consent management functions. Implement data retention policy enforcement. Create regulatory reporting templates (FDA, CMS). Develop validation for international standards (GDPR, PIPEDA). Test with compliance checklists, penetration testing for security features, and validation against regulatory requirements documentation.

## 4. Develop medi.ai Module [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
