# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Standard Library: medi.data Module
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the medi.data module with FHIR resource definitions and parsers, native representation of healthcare data structures, querying capabilities for patient records, and data validation against healthcare standards.
# Details:
Create the medi.data standard library module:
1. FHIR R4 resource definitions and parsers
2. Native Medi representations of healthcare data structures
3. Query engine for patient records using FHIR paths
4. Data validation against healthcare standards
5. Serialization/deserialization for healthcare formats

Implementation approach:
- Generate Medi type definitions from FHIR R4 specification
- Implement FHIR path query engine
- Create efficient in-memory representations of healthcare data
- Develop validation rules based on FHIR profiles
- Implement JSON/XML parsers for healthcare data
- Create query optimization for common healthcare data access patterns

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for FHIR resource handling
2. Query performance benchmarks
3. Validation tests against FHIR test suite
4. Interoperability tests with existing FHIR servers
5. Memory efficiency tests with large datasets
6. Conformance testing against FHIR specification

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement FHIR resource definitions and parsers [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create comprehensive FHIR resource class definitions and parsers that can handle all required FHIR resources (Patient, Observation, Medication, etc.)
### Details:
Implement class structures for FHIR resources with proper inheritance hierarchy. Create parsers that can validate and transform raw FHIR JSON/XML into structured objects. Include support for FHIR extensions and ensure compliance with the latest FHIR specification version.

## 2. Develop native healthcare data structure representations [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1
### Description: Create internal data structures optimized for healthcare data that can efficiently represent clinical information beyond FHIR
### Details:
Design and implement domain-specific data structures for clinical concepts, time-series data, and hierarchical medical taxonomies. Include support for medical coding systems (SNOMED CT, LOINC, ICD-10) and create mapping functions between FHIR resources and these native structures.

## 3. Build patient record query engine [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Implement a flexible query engine that allows efficient retrieval and filtering of patient healthcare data
### Details:
Create a query DSL (Domain Specific Language) for healthcare data access patterns. Implement indexing strategies for common query paths. Support temporal queries, code-based filtering, and complex clinical criteria. Ensure the engine can handle both FHIR-based and native data structure queries.

## 4. Implement healthcare standards validation [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2
### Description: Create validation mechanisms to ensure data conforms to healthcare standards and terminology systems
### Details:
Implement validators for FHIR profiles and implementation guides. Add support for terminology validation against standard code systems. Create constraint checking for clinical data integrity and implement validation reporting that provides detailed error information.

## 5. Develop serialization/deserialization for healthcare formats [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.4
### Description: Implement conversion utilities for various healthcare data formats beyond FHIR (HL7v2, CDA, DICOM)
### Details:
Create serializers and deserializers for legacy healthcare formats. Implement bidirectional conversion between FHIR and other formats. Support bulk import/export operations and ensure data fidelity during format conversions.

## 6. Optimize performance for healthcare data operations [pending]
### Dependencies: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5
### Description: Implement performance optimizations for healthcare data access patterns and large dataset handling
### Details:
Profile and optimize critical data paths. Implement lazy loading strategies for large resources. Create caching mechanisms for frequently accessed data. Optimize memory usage for large patient datasets and implement parallel processing for bulk operations.
