# Task ID: 9
# Title: IDE with Visual Programming Interface
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop Medi Studio IDE with code editing and visual programming capabilities
# Details:
Implement the Medi Studio IDE with both code editing and visual programming capabilities. This includes:

1. Create code editor with healthcare-aware features
2. Implement visual programming interface for non-programmers
3. Develop debugging and profiling tools
4. Create project management capabilities
5. Implement healthcare-specific code completion and suggestions
6. Develop integrated documentation and help system

The IDE should support both traditional code editing and visual programming approaches to accommodate users with different technical backgrounds.

Example features:
- Drag-and-drop interface for creating data pipelines
- Visual query builder for FHIR resources
- Interactive visualization editor
- Natural language query interface
- Contextual help for healthcare concepts
- Code/visual switching for the same program

Implementation approach:
- Build on Electron or similar framework for cross-platform support
- Implement language server protocol for code intelligence
- Create custom visual programming components for healthcare
- Develop bidirectional translation between visual and code representations

# Test Strategy:
1. Create unit tests for IDE components
2. Test visual programming with healthcare workflows
3. Verify code generation from visual representation
4. Test debugging and profiling tools
5. Validate healthcare-specific code completion
6. Test cross-platform functionality
7. Create usability tests with healthcare professionals of varying technical backgrounds

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Core Code Editor [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop the foundational code editing environment with syntax highlighting, code folding, and basic editing features
### Details:
Create a robust text editor component with healthcare-specific syntax highlighting for common languages (Python, R, SQL). Implement standard IDE features like line numbering, search/replace, and code folding. Ensure the editor has proper performance optimization for handling large healthcare datasets and algorithms.

## 2. Develop Visual Programming Interface [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create a drag-and-drop interface for visual programming with healthcare-specific components and workflows
### Details:
Design and implement a canvas-based visual programming environment with nodes and connections. Create healthcare-specific node types (data import, preprocessing, analysis, visualization). Ensure the visual interface supports common healthcare workflows like patient data analysis, clinical trial processing, and medical imaging.

## 3. Build Bidirectional Translation System [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Develop a system that translates between visual programming constructs and code, maintaining synchronization between both representations
### Details:
Create parsers and generators that convert visual programming structures to code and vice versa. Implement real-time synchronization so changes in either environment reflect in the other. Handle edge cases and complex structures while preserving code comments and custom logic.

## 4. Implement Debugging Tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Create comprehensive debugging capabilities for both code and visual programming interfaces
### Details:
Develop breakpoints, variable inspection, and step-through debugging for code. Create visual debugging tools for the graphical interface with node state visualization. Implement healthcare-specific debugging features like dataset validation and HIPAA compliance checking.

## 5. Develop Project Management Features [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2
### Description: Implement project organization, version control integration, and collaboration tools
### Details:
Create project structure management with healthcare-specific templates. Integrate with Git and other version control systems. Implement collaboration features like shared editing, commenting, and change tracking with HIPAA-compliant security measures.

## 6. Implement Healthcare-Specific Code Completion and Documentation [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.3
### Description: Develop intelligent code suggestions and comprehensive documentation system tailored to healthcare development
### Details:
Create an AI-powered code completion system trained on healthcare codebases. Implement context-aware suggestions for medical terminology, common algorithms, and compliance requirements. Develop an integrated documentation system with healthcare coding standards, regulatory information, and best practices.

## 7. Conduct Usability Testing and Optimization [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3, 9.4, 9.5, 9.6
### Description: Perform comprehensive testing with healthcare developers and optimize the IDE based on feedback
### Details:
Design and execute usability tests with healthcare developers of varying experience levels. Collect metrics on common tasks, pain points, and feature usage. Implement improvements based on feedback, focusing on workflow efficiency for healthcare-specific development tasks.
