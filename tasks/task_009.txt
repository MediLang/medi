# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Basic IDE with Visual Analytics
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1, 2, 8
# Priority: low
# Description: Create a basic IDE with visual analytics capabilities, support for .mdi file recognition, syntax highlighting, basic code completion, and a prototype of the visual programming interface.
# Details:
Implement a basic IDE:
1. Editor with syntax highlighting for Medi
2. Basic code completion for healthcare constructs
3. Visual analytics for healthcare data
4. .mdi file recognition and project management
5. Prototype visual programming interface
6. Integration with compiler and development tools

Implementation approach:
- Build on existing editor frameworks (VS Code, Eclipse, etc.)
- Implement language server protocol for Medi
- Create visualization components for healthcare data
- Design visual programming blocks for common healthcare operations
- Implement project templates for healthcare applications
- Create debugging tools with healthcare data inspection

# Test Strategy:
1. Editor functionality testing
2. Code completion accuracy validation
3. Visual analytics rendering tests
4. Visual programming usability testing
5. Integration testing with compiler and tools
6. Cross-platform compatibility testing

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement syntax highlighting for healthcare DSL [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop syntax highlighting capabilities for the healthcare domain-specific language to improve code readability
### Details:
Create token definitions for healthcare-specific keywords, functions, and data types. Implement color schemes that distinguish between different elements (variables, functions, keywords). Test with various healthcare code snippets to ensure proper highlighting.

## 2. Develop code completion for healthcare constructs [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build intelligent code completion functionality that suggests healthcare-specific constructs and functions
### Details:
Implement autocompletion for medical terminology, healthcare workflows, and domain-specific functions. Create context-aware suggestions based on the current scope. Include documentation tooltips for suggested items.

## 3. Create visual analytics components [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and implement visual components for healthcare data visualization within the IDE
### Details:
Develop chart and graph components for displaying patient data, treatment outcomes, and other healthcare metrics. Implement interactive visualization tools that can be embedded in the code. Create a component library with healthcare-specific visualization templates.

## 4. Build file recognition and project management system [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Implement file recognition for healthcare DSL files and create project management capabilities
### Details:
Develop file type associations for healthcare DSL files. Create project templates for common healthcare applications. Implement a project explorer with healthcare-specific organization. Add dependency management for healthcare libraries and frameworks.

## 5. Develop visual programming interface prototype [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.3, 9.4
### Description: Create a prototype for a visual programming interface tailored to healthcare workflows
### Details:
Design a drag-and-drop interface for creating healthcare workflows. Implement node-based programming components for common healthcare processes. Create a bidirectional translation between visual representation and code. Test usability with healthcare domain experts.

## 6. Integrate with compiler tools [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.4
### Description: Connect the IDE with compiler and runtime tools for the healthcare DSL
### Details:
Implement build system integration for compiling healthcare DSL code. Add error reporting and inline diagnostics for code issues. Create debugging tools specific to healthcare applications. Implement deployment options for healthcare environments.
