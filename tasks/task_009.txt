# Task ID: 9
# Title: Implement Example Use Cases
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Develop working examples for the key use cases: Clinical Data Exploration, Basic Regulatory Compliance, Simple Statistical Analysis, and Synthetic Data Testing.
# Details:
Implement working examples for the four key use cases specified in the PRD:

1. Clinical Data Exploration:
```medi
let patients = fhir_query("Patient")
    .filter(p => p.age > 65 && p.condition("diabetes"))
    .limit(100);

let avg_a1c = patients.observation("hba1c").mean();
println!("Average HbA1c: {:.1}%", avg_a1c);
```

2. Basic Regulatory Compliance:
```medi
regulate {
  standard: "HIPAA",
  data: patient_records,
  checks: ["de_identification", "minimum_necessary"]
};

let analysis = analyze(patient_records);
```

3. Simple Statistical Analysis:
```medi
let trial_data = load_csv("trial_results.csv");
let treatment_group = trial_data.filter(p => p.group == "treatment");
let control_group = trial_data.filter(p => p.group == "control");

let t_test = stats.t_test(treatment_group.outcome, control_group.outcome);
println!("P-value: {:.4}", t_test.p_value);
```

4. Synthetic Data Testing:
```medi
let synthetic_patients = generate_synthetic_patients(100, {
  demographics: "realistic",
  conditions: ["diabetes", "hypertension"],
  observations: ["glucose", "blood_pressure"]
});

let analysis = run_risk_model(synthetic_patients);
```

Ensure that all examples work end-to-end with the implemented compiler and standard library. Create sample datasets for testing these examples.

# Test Strategy:
Create end-to-end tests for each use case. Test with real and synthetic healthcare data. Verify correct output for each example. Measure performance against the targets specified in the PRD. Test integration with the standard library modules. Ensure compliance checking works correctly in the regulatory example.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement Clinical Data Exploration Use Case [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Develop a comprehensive example demonstrating how to explore and analyze clinical datasets using the language's data manipulation features.
### Details:
Create a step-by-step tutorial showing how to load clinical data (FHIR or similar format), filter patients by criteria, extract relevant medical information, and visualize key metrics. Include code samples for common operations like cohort selection, timeline visualization, and basic patient statistics. Use realistic (but anonymized) sample data and document all functions used.

## 2. Implement Basic Regulatory Compliance Use Case [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Create an example showing how the language handles HIPAA and other healthcare compliance requirements in code.
### Details:
Develop a tutorial demonstrating data anonymization techniques, audit logging, access control implementation, and secure data storage patterns. Include code examples for de-identification functions, consent management, and automated compliance checking. Document how the language's features specifically address regulatory requirements with concrete implementation examples.

## 3. Implement Simple Statistical Analysis Use Case [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1
### Description: Build an example showcasing statistical analysis capabilities for healthcare data using the language's built-in functions.
### Details:
Create a comprehensive example that demonstrates descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, correlation analysis, and basic predictive modeling on healthcare data. Include code for analyzing treatment outcomes, identifying risk factors, and generating statistical reports. Provide sample datasets and expected outputs with interpretations of the results.

## 4. Implement Synthetic Data Testing Use Case [pending]
### Dependencies: 9.1, 9.2, 9.3
### Description: Develop an example showing how to generate and validate synthetic healthcare data for testing applications.
### Details:
Create a tutorial demonstrating how to generate realistic synthetic patient records, medical events, and longitudinal data. Include code for data validation, statistical similarity testing with real data, and integration testing scenarios. Document methods for controlling data characteristics, ensuring clinical plausibility, and scaling data generation for different testing needs.
