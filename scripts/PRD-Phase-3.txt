### 1. Self-Hosted Compiler Components
**User Story:** As a Medi language contributor, I want to work on a self-hosted parser implementation.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 3
module medi::medic::parser;

use medi::medic::lexer::Token;
use medi::medic::ast::{Expr, Stmt, TypeExpr};

pub struct Parser {
    tokens: Vec<Token>,
    current: usize,
}

impl Parser {
    pub fn new(tokens: Vec<Token>) -> Self {
        Parser { tokens, current: 0 }
    }
    
    pub fn parse_program(&mut self) -> Result<Vec<Stmt>, String> {
        let mut statements = Vec::new();
        
        while !self.is_at_end() {
            match self.parse_statement() {
                Ok(stmt) => statements.push(stmt),
                Err(e) => return Err(e),
            }
        }
        
        Ok(statements)
    }
    
    fn parse_fhir_query(&mut self) -> Result<Expr, String> {
        // Implementation of FHIR query parsing specific to Medi
        // ...
    }
}
```

### 2. Clinical Decision Support with AI
**User Story:** As a clinician, I want to use Medi to create and deploy clinical decision support tools using AI.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 3
let patient_records = fhir_query("Patient")
    .with("Observation")
    .with("MedicationStatement")
    .where(p => p.age >= 50);

// Load pre-trained model from registry with explainability
let sepsis_model = ai.load_model(
    "healthcare.models/sepsis-predictor:v2.1",
    explainability: .shap,
    validation: .clinical_guidelines("sepsis-3")
);

// Predict with confidence intervals and explanations
let predictions = sepsis_model.predict(patient_records, {
    confidence_intervals: true,
    threshold: 0.7,
    time_horizon: hours(24)
});

// Generate clinical alerts with explanations
for patient, prediction in predictions {
    if prediction.probability > 0.8 {
        clinical_alert {
            patient: patient.id,
            condition: "Potential Sepsis Risk",
            probability: prediction.probability,
            explanation: prediction.factors.top(5),
            suggested_actions: sepsis_protocol.steps_for(patient)
        }
    }
}
```

### 3. Enterprise Integration with EHR Systems
**User Story:** As a healthcare IT director, I want to integrate Medi analytics with our Epic EHR system.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 3
// Secure connection to Epic using SMART on FHIR
let epic = connect_ehr {
    system: .epic,
    auth: oauth2 {
        client_id: env("EPIC_CLIENT_ID"),
        client_secret: env("EPIC_CLIENT_SECRET"),
        scope: ["patient/*.read", "user/*.read"]
    },
    audit: .enabled
};

// Register analytics workflow
@epic.register_workflow(
    name: "Readmission Risk Analysis",
    schedule: "daily at 2:00 AM",
    permissions: ["read:Encounter", "read:Patient", "write:Flag"]
)
fn analyze_readmission_risk() {
    // Get recent discharges
    let recent_discharges = epic.query(
        "Encounter?status=finished&date=gt{{today()-7d}}&type=inpatient"
    );
    
    // Analyze readmission risk
    for discharge in recent_discharges {
        let patient = discharge.patient;
        let risk_score = readmission_model.predict(patient);
        
        if risk_score > 0.7 {
            // Create high-risk flag in Epic
            epic.create("Flag", {
                patient: patient.id,
                code: {
                    coding: [{
                        system: "local",
                        code: "high-readmission-risk"
                    }]
                },
                status: "active",
                period: { start: today() },
                category: {
                    coding: [{
                        system: "http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/flag-category",
                        code: "clinical"
                    }]
                }
            });
            
            // Notify care coordinator
            epic.notify_role("care-coordinator", {
                patient: patient.id,
                message: "High readmission risk ({{risk_score*100}}%)"
            });
        }
    }
}
```

### 4. Federated Learning Across Institutions
**User Story:** As a medical researcher, I want to train AI models across multiple institutions without sharing raw data.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 3
// Define federated learning configuration
let fl_config = federated::config {
    coordinator: "research-consortium.org/fl-server",
    participants: [
        "hospital-a.org/fl-node",
        "hospital-b.org/fl-node",
        "hospital-c.org/fl-node"
    ],
    aggregation: .secure_aggregation,
    privacy: differential_privacy {
        epsilon: 0.8,
        delta: 1e-5,
        mechanism: .gaussian
    },
    convergence_criteria: {
        min_rounds: 10,
        max_rounds: 50,
        metric: "validation_auc",
        patience: 5
    }
};

// Define model architecture
let pneumonia_model = ai.model::sequential([
    layer::input(shape: [224, 224, 3]),
    layer::conv2d(filters: 32, kernel_size: 3, activation: "relu"),
    layer::max_pooling2d(pool_size: 2),
    layer::conv2d(filters: 64, kernel_size: 3, activation: "relu"),
    layer::max_pooling2d(pool_size: 2),
    layer::flatten(),
    layer::dense(units: 128, activation: "relu"),
    layer::dense(units: 1, activation: "sigmoid")
]);

// Train across institutions
let trained_model = federated::train(
    model: pneumonia_model,
    config: fl_config,
    dataset: {
        x: "chest_xray",
        y: "pneumonia_diagnosis",

        optimizer: "adam",
        loss: "binary_crossentropy",
        metrics: ["auc", "precision", "recall"]
    }
);

// Deploy model to clinical workflow
ai.register_model(
    model: trained_model,
    name: "federated-pneumonia-detection",
    version: "1.0.0",
    metadata: {
        training_method: "federated_learning",
        participating_sites: fl_config.participants.count(),
        performance: trained_model.metrics,
        privacy_guarantee: fl_config.privacy
    }
);
```

### 5. Hospital Operations Optimization
**User Story:** As a hospital operations manager, I want to optimize resource allocation and predict patient flow.
```medi
// Example code to be supported in Phase 3
// Import historical data
let historical_data = load_data(
    sources: [
        hospital_db.table("admissions", timeframe: years(3)),
        hospital_db.table("staffing", timeframe: years(3)),
        hospital_db.table("bed_utilization", timeframe: years(3))
    ],
    join_on: "date"
);

// Feature engineering
let features = historical_data
    .add_feature("day_of_week", d => d.date.day_of_week())
    .add_feature("is_holiday", d => calendar.is_holiday(d.date))
    .add_feature("season", d => calendar.season(d.date))
    .add_feature("flu_intensity", d => public_health.flu_index(d.date))
    .normalize(method: .z_score);

// Train forecasting model
let forecast_model = ai.train(
    model_type: .prophet,
    data: features,
    target: "daily_admissions",
    parameters: {
        changepoints: true,
        seasonality: {
            yearly: true,
            weekly: true,
            daily: false
        },
        extra_regressors: ["flu_intensity", "is_holiday"]
    }
);

// Optimize staffing based on forecasts
let next_month = date_range(start: today(), days: 30);
let admission_forecast = forecast_model.predict(next_month);

let staffing_plan = resource_optimizer.optimize(
    forecast: admission_forecast,
    resources: {
        nurses: {
            skills: ["icu", "med_surg", "ed"],
            shift_duration: hours(12),
            min_rest: hours(12),
            max_consecutive_shifts: 3
        },
        beds: {
            categories: ["icu", "med_surg", "observation"],
            total_capacity: { "icu": 42, "med_surg": 120, "observation": 36 }
        }
    },
    constraints: {
        nurse_to_patient_ratio: { "icu": 1/2, "med_surg": 1/5, "observation": 1/6 },
        max_bed_utilization: 0.85,
        min_float_nurses: 2
    },
    objective: .minimize_cost
);

// Generate reports and visualizations
report::staffing_plan(staffing_plan)
    .with_daily_breakdown()
    .with_cost_analysis()
    .export_to("staffing_plan_next_month.pdf");

dashboard::patient_flow(admission_forecast)
    .with_bed_utilization()
    .with_staffing_overlay(staffing_plan)
    .deploy_to(hospital_operations_portal);
```
