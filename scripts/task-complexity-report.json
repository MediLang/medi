      "taskTitle": "Implement Recursive Descent Parser for Medi Core Syntax",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the recursive descent parser implementation into specific subtasks including: lexical analyzer development, core parser implementation, healthcare-specific syntax support, AST generation, semantic analysis, error reporting system, and comprehensive testing framework.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a complex recursive descent parser with healthcare-specific extensions. The time complexity can be significant due to the recursive nature of the parser and the need for extensive testing. The task requires specialized knowledge of parsing techniques, AST generation, and healthcare domain concepts."

      "recommendedSubtasks": 8,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the healthcare type system implementation into subtasks covering: primitive type definitions, healthcare-specific type hierarchy, type checking rules implementation, type inference algorithm, patient data safety mechanisms, privacy annotations, compatibility rules, and comprehensive testing.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a type system with healthcare-specific types requires deep understanding of both type theory and healthcare domain knowledge. The Hindley-Milner type inference with extensions adds significant complexity, and the privacy/compliance annotations introduce additional challenges."
