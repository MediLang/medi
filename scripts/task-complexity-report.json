      "taskTitle": "Implement Lexer and Parser for Medi Language",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Lexer and Parser implementation task into 5 subtasks, including token definition, lexer implementation, parser implementation, AST generation, and error reporting. For each subtask, provide a clear description, acceptance criteria, and estimated complexity.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves implementing a recursive descent parser which has significant complexity due to the need to handle healthcare-specific constructs, UTF-8 encoding, and AST generation. Recursive descent parsers require careful implementation of mutually recursive procedures and can have exponential time complexity in worst cases. The task also requires clinician-friendly error reporting, which adds another layer of complexity."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Healthcare-Specific Type System task into 4 subtasks covering basic type implementation, healthcare type definitions, type checking/inference implementation, and safety guarantees for patient data. For each subtask, specify implementation details, testing approach, and integration points with the parser.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing a type system with healthcare-specific types requires significant design work and integration with the parser. The task includes type inference which adds complexity, along with traits and safety guarantees for patient data handling. The dependency on the parser task increases the overall complexity."

      "taskTitle": "Build LLVM Backend Integration for Compiler",
      "complexityScore": 9,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 6,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the LLVM Backend Integration task into 6 subtasks covering LLVM setup, AST to IR translation, target-specific code generation (x86-64, WebAssembly, RISC-V), optimization pipeline, integration with type system, and testing framework. For each subtask, provide implementation details and validation criteria.",
      "reasoning": "LLVM backend integration is highly complex, requiring deep understanding of both the LLVM infrastructure and compiler design. The task involves translating AST to LLVM IR, supporting multiple targets (x86-64, WebAssembly, RISC-V), implementing optimizations for healthcare workloads, and integrating with the type system. This requires specialized knowledge and careful implementation."

      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 5,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Memory Management and Runtime System task into 5 subtasks covering borrow checker implementation, garbage collection for safe zone, real-time zone for IoT, task-based parallelism, and error handling. For each subtask, provide implementation details, testing approach, and performance requirements.",
      "reasoning": "Memory management with Rust-like borrow checking is inherently complex, requiring sophisticated static analysis. The runtime system adds additional complexity with multi-threading support, channel-based message passing, and specialized zones for different memory management strategies. The task also requires optimization for edge device deployments."

      "reasoning": "Developing four core standard library modules with healthcare-specific functionality is moderately complex. Each module requires domain expertise in healthcare data structures, statistics, compliance regulations, and AI integration. The modules must work together cohesively while providing a clean API for developers."

      "complexityScore": 7,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 4,
      "expansionPrompt": "Divide the Privacy and Compliance Checking task into 4 subtasks covering PHI data flow analysis, detection of unprotected PHI usage, verification of proper anonymization, and integration with the regulate construct. For each subtask, provide implementation details, testing approach, and regulatory requirements.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing privacy and compliance checking requires deep understanding of HIPAA and GDPR regulations, as well as static analysis techniques. The task involves analyzing data flows, detecting potential privacy violations, and ensuring proper handling of protected health information, which adds significant complexity."

For each subtask, provide implementation details, user experience requirements, and integration points with other components.",
      "reasoning": "Building a CLI and REPL is moderately complex, involving command-line argument parsing, interactive session management, and integration with the compiler. The healthcare data visualization adds some complexity, but overall this task is more straightforward than the core compiler components."

For each subtask, provide implementation details, user experience requirements, and integration points.",
      "reasoning": "Developing a basic IDE involves multiple components including syntax highlighting, code completion, and visual analytics. The integration with the language server protocol and creation of visualization components for healthcare data adds complexity. The visual programming interface prototype further increases the scope."

For each subtask, provide implementation details, required datasets, and validation criteria.",
      "reasoning": "Implementing the four example use cases is moderately complex, requiring integration with various components of the language and standard library. Each use case focuses on a different aspect of healthcare programming, from data exploration to regulatory compliance, statistical analysis, and synthetic data testing."
