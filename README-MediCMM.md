# Medi-CMM: Computational Molecular Medicine DSL extension

Medi-CMM is a domain-specific programming language designed to advance computational approaches in molecular medicine. Medi-CMM bridges the gap between computational methods and healthcare applications by providing specialized syntax and abstractions for molecular modeling, simulation, and analysis. This language enables researchers, computational biologists, and healthcare professionals to develop solutions in drug discovery, molecular diagnostics, and personalized medicine through accessible programming constructs.

## Scientific Foundation

Medi-CMM is built on established scientific frameworks including:

- **Molecular Dynamics Simulations**: Implementing physics-based force fields (AMBER, CHARMM, GROMOS) to simulate biomolecular interactions
- **Quantum Chemistry Methods**: Integrating density functional theory (DFT) calculations for accurate electronic structure modeling
- **Bioinformatics Algorithms**: Incorporating sequence alignment, structural prediction, and evolutionary analysis tools
- **Statistical Mechanics**: Applying principles for thermodynamic calculations and free energy estimations
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Leveraging supervised and unsupervised learning methods optimized for molecular and biological data

Rather than claiming to directly "move atoms," Medi-CMM provides a computational environment to model, simulate, and analyze molecular systems relevant to healthcare applications.

## Key Features

Medi-CMM offers features tailored for computational molecular medicine:

## Latency & Throughput

Medi-CMM targets predictable performance for interactive scientific workflows:

- **Minor GC pauses:** Generational nursery collections aim for sub-10ms p99 under typical workloads via a remembered set that limits traversal.
- **Incremental Major GC (prototype):** A feature-gated incremental major collector respects `GcParams.max_pause_ms` by chunking mark/sweep into small steps, keeping pause times bounded while completing full-heap work across steps.
- **Benchmarks:** Criterion benchmarks (see Medi repository README) provide p50/p99 for minor/major (incremental) and throughput measurements to guide tuning for large models and datasets.

- **Biomolecular Syntax**: Domain-specific constructs for representing proteins, nucleic acids, small molecules, and their interactions
- **Simulation Frameworks**: Built-in methods for molecular dynamics, Monte Carlo simulations, and quantum mechanical calculations
- **ML/AI Integration**: Native support for molecular representation learning, binding affinity prediction, and generative models
- **Interoperability**: Seamless connections to established tools like PyRosetta, AutoDock, AlphaFold, and RDKit
- **High-Performance Computing**: Optimized for parallel computing environments and GPU acceleration
- **Reproducibility Tools**: Version control for molecular models and simulation parameters
- **Regulatory Compliance**: Structure for documenting computational experiments in accordance with regulatory requirements

## Scientific Limitations and Scope

Medi operates within the boundaries of established computational methods and does not claim capabilities beyond current scientific understanding:

- **Molecular Simulation Accuracy**: Subject to the same force field limitations and computational constraints as other molecular modeling tools
- **Predictive Power**: Models provide useful approximations but cannot perfectly predict experimental outcomes
- **Scale Limitations**: Cannot simultaneously model systems at atomic detail beyond established size limits (~millions of atoms)
- **Time Scale Constraints**: Molecular dynamics simulations typically limited to microsecond timescales without enhanced sampling techniques
## Hardware Requirements

- Computationally intensive operations require appropriate HPC resources

## Research and Educational Value

Beyond practical applications, Medi serves as:

- **Educational Platform**: Provides accessible abstractions for teaching computational molecular science
- **Research Tool**: Enables rapid prototyping of computational experiments in molecular medicine
- **Interdisciplinary Bridge**: Creates common ground between computational scientists and healthcare researchers

By making computational molecular medicine more accessible through domain-specific programming constructs, Medi aims to accelerate research and innovation while maintaining scientific rigor and accuracy.
