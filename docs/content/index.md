Medi is a programming language purpose-built for healthcare, designed to transform medical analytics with unparalleled ease, speed, and security. With a beginner-friendly syntax inspired by Python and R, high performance rivaling Julia, Rust, and C++, and native support for healthcare standards like FHIR, HL7, and DICOM, Medi empowers clinicians, researchers, and developers to unlock insights from complex medical data. New to healthcare informatics? Check out our [comprehensive glossary](./glossary.md) of healthcare and bioinformatics terms.

## Why Medi?

Healthcare demands tools that balance accessibility, performance, security, and compliance. Existing languages fall short:

* **Python/R:** Versatile but slow for big data, lack native healthcare standards, and require complex integrations.
* **SAS/Stata:** Expensive, proprietary, and cumbersome for modern workflows.
* **Julia:** Fast but not healthcare-specific, with a smaller ecosystem.

Medi fills these gaps with a language tailored for healthcare, offering:

* **Native Healthcare Standards:** Built-in support for FHIR, HL7, DICOM, and genomic formats (FASTQ, VCF).
* **Privacy-Preserving Analytics:** Federated learning and differential privacy for secure data science and AI.
* **Real-Time IoT Processing:** Optimized for wearables and ICU devices, enabling instant insights.
* **Regulatory Automation:** Automated compliance checks and reporting for HIPAA, GDPR, FDA, and EMA.
* **Clinician-Friendly Syntax:** Intuitive, Python/R-like syntax and a visual IDE for non-programmers.
* **High Performance:** Compiled to machine code via LLVM, with WebAssembly and RISC-V support for edge devices.
* **Versatile Applications:** Genomics, clinical trials, epidemiology, hospital analytics, telemedicine, imaging, R&D, and more.
* **Rust-Inspired Design:** Clean, modern syntax with explicit visibility modifiers (`pub`), module system, and pattern matching.
