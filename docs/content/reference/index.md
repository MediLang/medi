# Medi Language Reference

## Overview

Medi is a programming language purpose-built for healthcare, designed to transform medical analytics with unparalleled ease, speed, and security. With a beginner-friendly syntax inspired by Python and R, high performance rivaling Julia, Rust, and C++, and native support for healthcare standards like FHIR, HL7, and DICOM, Medi empowers clinicians, researchers, and developers to unlock insights from complex medical data.

## Core Features

### Healthcare-Specific Features

- **Native Healthcare Standards:** Built-in support for FHIR, HL7, DICOM, and genomic formats (FASTQ, VCF).
- **Privacy-Preserving Analytics:** Federated learning and differential privacy for secure data science and AI.
- **Real-Time IoT Processing:** Optimized for wearables and ICU devices, enabling instant insights.
- **Regulatory Automation:** Automated compliance checks and reporting for HIPAA, GDPR, FDA, and EMA.

### Language Features

- **Clinician-Friendly Syntax:** Intuitive, Python/R-like syntax and a visual IDE for non-programmers.
- **High Performance:** Compiled to machine code via LLVM, with WebAssembly and RISC-V support for edge devices.
- **Parallel Processing:** Multi-threading (OpenMP) and distributed computing (MPI/Spark) for scalable analytics.
- **GPU Support:** CUDA/OpenCL integration for AI-driven diagnostics and imaging (e.g., MRI segmentation).
- **Hybrid Memory Management:** Lightweight garbage collection (like Go) for simplicity, with Rust-inspired manual control (`scope`) for low-latency IoT tasks.

## Application Domains

Medi supports a wide range of healthcare applications:

- Genomics and bioinformatics
- Clinical trials and research
- Epidemiology and public health
- Hospital operations and management
- Telemedicine and remote monitoring
