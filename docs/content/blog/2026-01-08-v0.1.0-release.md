# Medi v0.1.0: Phase 1 Complete — A Healthcare Programming Language is Born

**January 8, 2026** | *Release Announcement*

---

Today marks a major milestone for the Medi programming language: the release of **v0.1.0**, completing Phase 1 of our development roadmap. After months of intensive development, we're proud to deliver a fully functional prototype that demonstrates Medi's unique value proposition for healthcare software development.

## What is Medi?

Medi is a high-level, domain-specific programming language purpose-built for healthcare. It combines:

- **Beginner-friendly syntax** inspired by Python and R
- **High performance** rivaling Julia, Rust, and C++
- **Native support** for healthcare standards (FHIR, HL7, DICOM)
- **Built-in privacy** and compliance checking (HIPAA, GDPR)
- **AI/ML integration** for clinical decision support

Whether you're a clinician exploring patient data, a researcher running clinical trials, or a developer building healthcare applications, Medi is designed to make your work easier, faster, and safer.

## What's in v0.1.0?

### Complete Language Core

The foundation is solid. Medi v0.1.0 includes:

- **Lexer & Parser**: Full recursive descent parser with healthcare-specific constructs like `fhir_query`, `regulate`, and `predict_risk`
- **Type System**: Healthcare-aware types (`FHIRPatient`, `Observation`, `Vital`, `LabResult`) with type inference
- **Borrow Checker**: Rust-inspired memory safety without garbage collection overhead
- **LLVM Backend**: Efficient code generation with optimization passes

### Multi-Target Compilation

Write once, deploy anywhere:

| Target | Use Case |
|--------|----------|
| **x86-64** | Servers, workstations |
| **WebAssembly** | Browser-based analytics |
| **RISC-V (RV32)** | Medical IoT devices |

### Healthcare Standard Library

Four powerful modules ready to use:

#### `medi.data`
```medi
let patients = fhir_query("Patient")
    .filter(p => p.age > 65 && p.condition("diabetes"))
    .limit(100);
```
- FHIR R4 resource definitions (Patient, Observation, Medication, Procedure, Condition, Encounter, DiagnosticReport)
- HL7 v2.x message parsing
- DICOM metadata extraction
- Validation profiles (US Core, International Patient Summary)
- FHIR Bundle support for transactions and batches

#### `medi.stats`
```medi
let km = kaplan_meier(survival_times, events);
let p_value = log_rank_test(group1, group2);
```
- Survival analysis (Kaplan-Meier, log-rank test)
- Streaming statistics for real-time monitoring
- Bootstrap confidence intervals
- Time-series analysis (exponential smoothing)
- Numerically stable algorithms (Welford, Kahan summation)

#### `medi.compliance`
```medi
regulate {
    standard: "HIPAA",
    data: patient_records,
    checks: ["de_identification", "minimum_necessary"]
};
```
- HIPAA and GDPR rule engine with AND/OR/NOT logic
- Multiple anonymization strategies (mask, hash, redact)
- Audit trail generation
- Configurable severity levels

#### `medi.ai`
```medi
let model = load_model("diabetes_risk.onnx");
let risk = model.predict(patient_features);
let stratum = stratify_risk(risk);
```
- Model registry with versioning
- Pluggable backends (ONNX, TensorFlow Lite)
- Probability calibration (Platt scaling, isotonic regression)
- Validation metrics (ROC-AUC, precision, recall, F1)
- Fairness metrics (demographic parity, equal opportunity)

### Complete Toolchain

Everything you need to be productive:

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `medic` | Compiler with rich diagnostics |
| `medipack` | Package manager (init, build, check) |
| `medic repl` | Interactive shell with history |
| `medic doc` | Documentation generator |

### IDE Support

A web-based IDE prototype with:
- Syntax highlighting via CodeMirror 6
- Real-time diagnostics from the compiler
- Privacy violation detection

### Python Interoperability

Call Medi from Python with `pymedi`:

```python
import pymedi

result = pymedi.mean([1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0])
print(f"Mean: {result}")  # Mean: 3.0
```

## Clinician-Friendly by Design

One of our core principles is making Medi accessible to clinicians without extensive programming backgrounds. In v0.1.0, we've focused on:

### Clear Error Messages

Instead of cryptic compiler errors, Medi provides helpful guidance:

```
error: Expected an identifier
  --> patient_analysis.medi:5:5
   |
 5 | let = 100
   |     ^
   |
help: Did you forget the variable name? Example: `let x = 100`
```

### Domain-Aware Diagnostics

Type errors use clinical terminology:

```
error: Condition must be true/false (Bool), but found a number (Int).
       Try adding a comparison like '== 0' or '> 100'.
```

### Healthcare-Specific Help

The compiler understands medical context:

```
help: The 'per' operator divides quantities. Example: `dose per kg`
```

## Performance

Medi is designed for performance-critical healthcare workloads:

- **Compilation**: < 2 seconds for typical scripts
- **Runtime**: Within 2x of equivalent C++ code
- **Memory**: < 100MB compiler, < 50MB runtime footprint
- **Real-time**: O(1) allocation for IoT/wearable applications

## What's Next?

With Phase 1 complete, we're turning our attention to Phase 2:

- **Federated Learning**: Privacy-preserving ML across institutions
- **Enhanced FHIR**: Full R4 coverage with terminology services
- **Package Registry**: Share and discover Medi packages
- **Production Hardening**: Security audits and stability improvements
- **Real-World Pilots**: Partnerships with healthcare institutions

## Get Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/MediLang/medi.git
cd medi

# Build the compiler
cargo build --release

# Run the REPL
./target/release/medic repl
```

### Hello, Healthcare World

Create `hello.medi`:

```medi
module HelloHealthcare

let patient_count = 42;
print("Analyzing {} patients...", patient_count);

let avg_age = 67.5;
print("Average age: {:.1} years", avg_age);
```

Compile and run:

```bash
medic check hello.medi
```

## Thank You

This release wouldn't be possible without the vision of creating a programming language that truly understands healthcare. We believe that by combining the rigor of systems programming with the accessibility of scripting languages, and by building healthcare concepts directly into the language, we can transform how medical software is developed.

v0.1.0 is just the beginning. We're excited to see what you build with Medi.
