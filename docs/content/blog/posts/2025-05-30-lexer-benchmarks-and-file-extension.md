# Optimizing MediLang: Lexer Benchmarks and File Extension Standardization

*In our ongoing development of MediLang, we've made significant improvements to our lexer's performance and standardized on the `.medi` file extension. Here's a deep dive into what changed and why it matters.*

## The Need for Speed: Lexer Benchmarks

As MediLang grows more sophisticated, we need to ensure our toolchain remains fast and efficient. We implemented a comprehensive benchmarking suite to measure and compare the performance of our different lexer implementations.

### Meet the Lexers

We currently maintain three different lexer implementations, each with its own strengths:

1. **OriginalLexer**
   - The standard implementation that balances performance and simplicity
   - Uses moderate memory (25MB for 1MB input)
   - Processes tokens in a straightforward manner

2. **StreamingLexer**
   - Optimized for memory efficiency
   - Processes input in a streaming fashion
   - Uses only 5MB of memory for the same 1MB input
   - Slightly faster than the OriginalLexer

3. **ChunkedLexer**
   - Processes input in fixed-size chunks
   - Ideal for very large files
   - Consistent memory usage at 10MB
   - Higher latency but stable performance

### Benchmark Results

Here's how our lexers performed when processing a 1MB Medi source file:

| Lexer Type     | Min (ms) | Max (ms) | Avg (ms) | Memory (MB) |
|----------------|----------|----------|-----------|-------------|
| OriginalLexer  |   151.48 |   160.80 |    155.33 |        25.0 |
| StreamingLexer |   138.79 |   147.91 |    143.35 |         5.0 |
| ChunkedLexer   |   236.86 |   266.77 |    251.59 |        10.0 |


## Standardizing on .medi

We've also standardized on using `.medi` as the official file extension for Medi source files. This change brings several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: A single, standard extension makes it easier to identify Medi files
2. **Tooling**: Better support in editors and IDEs with proper syntax highlighting
3. **Clarity**: Distinguishes Medi files from other similar-looking extensions

### What Changed

- Updated all example code and documentation to use `.medi`
- Modified the compiler and tools to recognize `.medi` files
- Updated build systems and CI/CD pipelines

## Choosing the Right Lexer

Based on our benchmarks, here's our recommendation for choosing a lexer:

- **Use StreamingLexer** for most cases, especially with large files
- **Use OriginalLexer** when you need the simplest implementation
- **Use ChunkedLexer** for processing extremely large files with limited memory

## What's Next

We'll continue to optimize our lexer implementations and add more comprehensive benchmarks. Future work includes:

- Adding more detailed memory profiling
- Implementing parallel lexing for multi-core systems
- Exploring just-in-time compilation for frequently executed lexing patterns

## Get Involved

We'd love to hear about your experiences with these changes! If you have feedback or want to contribute to MediLang's development, check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MediLang/medi).

```medi
// Example Medi code with the new .medi extension
protocol PatientData {
  name: String
  age: Int
  conditions: [String]
}

function analyze_patient(patient: PatientData) -> RiskScore {
  // Implementation here
}
```

*Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve MediLang!*
