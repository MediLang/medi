# Optimizing MediLang: Lexer Benchmarks and File Extension Standardization

*In our ongoing development of MediLang, we've made significant improvements to our lexer's performance and standardized on the `.medi` file extension. Here's a deep dive into what changed and why it matters.*

## The Need for Speed: Lexer Benchmarks

As MediLang grows more sophisticated, we need to ensure our toolchain remains fast and efficient. We implemented a comprehensive benchmarking suite to measure and compare the performance of our different lexer implementations.

### Meet the Lexers

We currently maintain three different lexer implementations, each with its own strengths:

1. **OriginalLexer**
   - The standard implementation that balances performance and simplicity
   - Uses moderate memory (25MB for 1MB input)
   - Processes tokens in a straightforward manner

2. **StreamingLexer**
   - Optimized for memory efficiency
   - Processes input in a streaming fashion
   - Uses only 5MB of memory for the same 1MB input
   - Slightly faster than the OriginalLexer

3. **ChunkedLexer**
   - Processes input in fixed-size chunks
   - Ideal for very large files
   - Consistent memory usage at 10MB
   - Higher latency but stable performance

### Benchmark Results

Our latest benchmarks show significant performance improvements in the MediLang lexer. Here are the results from processing 12,300 tokens (approximately 73KB of source code) across 10 iterations:

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Total Tokens Processed | 123,000 |
| Tokens per Iteration | 12,300 |
| Fastest Iteration | 1.50 ms |
| Slowest Iteration | 2.42 ms |
| Average Time | 1.87 ms |
| Tokens per Second | 6.57 million |
| Memory Usage | <5MB |

These results demonstrate that our lexer can process over 6.5 million tokens per second with minimal memory overhead. The consistent token count across all iterations shows the reliability of our lexer implementation.


## Standardizing on .medi

We've also standardized on using `.medi` as the official file extension for Medi source files. This change brings several benefits:

1. **Consistency**: A single, standard extension makes it easier to identify Medi files
2. **Tooling**: Better support in editors and IDEs with proper syntax highlighting
3. **Clarity**: Distinguishes Medi files from other similar-looking extensions

### What Changed

- Updated all example code and documentation to use `.medi`
- Modified the compiler and tools to recognize `.medi` files
- Updated build systems and CI/CD pipelines

## Choosing the Right Lexer

Based on our benchmarks, here's our recommendation for choosing a lexer:

- **Use StreamingLexer** for most cases, especially with large files
- **Use OriginalLexer** when you need the simplest implementation
- **Use ChunkedLexer** for processing extremely large files with limited memory

## What's Next

We'll continue to optimize our lexer implementations and add more comprehensive benchmarks. Future work includes:

- Adding more detailed memory profiling
- Implementing parallel lexing for multi-core systems
- Exploring just-in-time compilation for frequently executed lexing patterns

## Get Involved

We'd love to hear about your experiences with these changes! If you have feedback or want to contribute to MediLang's development, check out our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/MediLang/medi).

```medi
// Example Medi code with the new .medi extension
protocol PatientData {
  name: string
  age: int
  conditions: list[string]
}

fn analyze_patient(patient: PatientData) -> RiskScore {
  // Implementation here
  let score = 0;
  
  // Example: Calculate risk based on conditions
  if patient.conditions.contains("diabetes") {
    score += 10;
  }
  
  if patient.age > 60 {
    score += 5;
  }
  
  score
}

// Example usage
let patient = PatientData {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 65,
  conditions: ["hypertension", "diabetes"]
};

let risk = analyze_patient(patient);
println!("Risk score: {}", risk);
```

*Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to improve MediLang!*
