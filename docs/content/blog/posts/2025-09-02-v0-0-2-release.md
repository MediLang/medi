# MediLang v0.0.2 Released

We’ve shipped MediLang v0.0.2 — a release focused on healthcare-native types, robust type annotation tests, and HIPAA-style privacy/data-flow checks. This milestone hardens correctness and reliability across the compiler pipeline.

## Highlights

- Robust type annotation tests for `let` bindings (match, mismatch, inference)
- Healthcare-first core types: `PatientId`, `Vital`, `LabResult`, `FHIRPatient`, `Observation`, and more
- HIPAA-style privacy flows: environment-driven sink and de-identification function recognition
- Lexer property-test stabilization; pre-commit checks now green end-to-end

## What’s in v0.0.2

### Type System & Tests
- Comprehensive `let` annotation tests in `tests/src/let_annotations.rs`
  - Match vs. mismatch with clear diagnostics
  - Inference without annotations
  - Complex nested struct annotations across `type` declarations
  - Side type-table assertions using the `TypeChecker` side table
- Unknown annotations align with checker semantics: `let y: Foo;` binds `Unknown` and records it (no error)

### Healthcare Types
- Domain-centric types for clinical data modeling
- Integration tests to validate clinical entities and operations

### Privacy & HIPAA-Style Flows
- Environment-driven function metadata for sinks and de-identification
  - `TypeEnv::{get_sink_fn, is_deid_fn}` consulted by the type checker
- Privacy annotations and enforcement (e.g., `PHI`, `Pseudonymized`, `Anonymized`, `Authorized`, `AuthorizedFor`)
- Unit/integration tests covering healthcare privacy flows

### Lexer Reliability
- Property-test sample adjusted to ensure parity between plain and chunked lexers
- All pre-commit checks (fmt, clippy, check, test) pass cleanly

## Try It

Clone and run tests:

```bash
# clone
git clone https://github.com/MediLang/medi.git
cd medi

# run the full test suite
cargo test --all
```

Optional lexer feature (`|>` as a single token):

```bash
cargo test -p medic_lexer --features pipeline_op
```
