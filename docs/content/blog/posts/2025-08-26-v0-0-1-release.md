# MediLang v0.0.1 Released

We’re excited to announce MediLang v0.0.1 — our first milestone with an end-to-end toolchain for healthcare-oriented programming.

## Highlights

- Core lexer and parser aligned with `LANG_SPEC.md`
- Unicode-aware source locations and robust streaming/chunked lexing
- Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) generation with position preservation and traversal
- Clinician-friendly error reporting with clear, contextual messages and recovery paths
- Feature-gated plan for a pipeline operator (`|>`) — default off, fully backward compatible

## What’s in v0.0.1

- Lexer
  - Healthcare-aware tokens and medical literals (e.g., `pid("PT123")`, `icd10("A00.0")`)
  - UTF‑8 and cross‑platform newline normalization, standardized error tokens
  - Streaming/chunked modes for large inputs with bounded memory
- Parser
  - Recursive descent covering core grammar and healthcare constructs
  - Operator precedence, nested expressions, and resilient error handling
- AST
  - Well-defined nodes, preserved locations, visitors, and tests
- Errors
  - Clear messages suitable for clinicians; recovery to continue parsing; test coverage
- Pipeline operator plan
  - Design for optional single-token `|>` behind `pipeline_op` Cargo feature
  - Default behavior unchanged: `|>` lexes as `|` + `>`; tests pass in both modes

## Enabling the optional pipeline operator

By default, `|>` is not a single token. To experiment with the feature-gated variant:

```bash
cargo test -p medic_lexer --features pipeline_op
```

This recognizes `|>` as a single token across streaming and chunked lexers, including cross-chunk boundaries.

## Getting Started

- Read the language docs in `docs/`
- Try the examples and run the test suite:

```bash
cargo test --all
```

## Looking Ahead

- Broader type system capabilities for healthcare data
- Continued performance work and more diagnostics polish
- Community feedback to guide next features

Thanks for following along — and thank you to contributors testing and profiling the early runtime!
