# Implementing Nested Expressions in MediLang: A Developer's Journey

*This is the first in a series of posts documenting the development of MediLang, a programming language designed specifically for healthcare applications.*

## The Challenge

When we started building MediLang, we knew we needed a way to express complex medical calculations in a way that felt natural to healthcare professionals. Traditional programming languages often fall short when it comes to medical-specific operations and units. Our solution? Build a language with first-class support for medical concepts.

## Our Development Journey

### Phase 1: Laying the Foundation (May 10-11)
- **PR #1**: Initial project setup and core parser infrastructure
- **PRs #3-4**: Documentation and build system configuration

### Phase 2: Building the Core (May 12-17)
- **PR #5**: First implementation of the recursive descent parser
- **PRs #6-8**: Multiple iterations to perfect the parser implementation
  - Added comprehensive test coverage
  - Improved error handling and recovery
  - Enhanced documentation and examples

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (May 18-24)
- **PRs #9-10**: Implemented custom operator precedence
  - Added support for medical operators (`of`, `per`)
  - Detailed documentation of operator behavior
- **PR #11**: Nested expressions and block statements
  - Full support for complex nested calculations
  - Improved syntax error messages
  - Edge case handling and optimizations

## Key Features

### Medical-Specific Operators

MediLang introduces operators that make medical calculations more intuitive:

```rust
// Calculate total medication dose
let total_medication = 2 of 500mg;  // 1000mg total

// Calculate infusion rate
let infusion_rate = 1000mL per 8hr;  // 125 mL/hr

// Complex calculation with proper precedence
let adjusted_dose = (weight * 2.5mg) + (age * 0.1mg) of medication;
```

### Error Messages That Help

We've put significant effort into making error messages helpful and actionable:

```
Error: Type mismatch in expression
  --> patient.medi:12:25
   |
12 | let dose = 2 of "500mg";
   |             ^ Expected number after 'of', found string
   |
   = help: Remove quotes to use a numeric literal
```

## Technical Deep Dive

### The Parser Architecture

Our recursive descent parser was carefully designed to handle the unique requirements of medical calculations:

1. **Operator Precedence**: Custom rules for medical operators
2. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of syntax errors
3. **Performance**: Optimized for the most common medical calculation patterns

### Testing Strategy

We implemented a comprehensive test suite covering:
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Nested expressions
- Edge cases in medical calculations
- Error conditions and recovery

## What We Learned

1. **Domain-Specific Languages Matter**
   Building operators that match medical professionals' mental models makes the language more accessible.

2. **Error Messages Are Crucial**
   Clear, actionable error messages significantly improve the development experience.

3. **Iterative Development Wins**
   Multiple small PRs with focused changes led to better code quality and easier reviews.

## What's Next

Our roadmap includes:

- [ ] Pattern matching for medical data types
- [ ] Built-in support for common medical calculations
- [ ] Enhanced IDE tooling and autocompletion
- [ ] Standard library of medical functions
