# Development Roadmap

Medi is under active development with a phased approach to deliver a full-featured healthcare programming language.

## Current Status

![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Pre--alpha%20(Prototype)-orange)

Medi is currently in pre-alpha stage, with core language features and initial modules under development.

## Phase 1: Prototype (6-12 Months)

The initial phase focuses on creating a functional language prototype:

* Build parser and LLVM-based compiler for core syntax
* Implement foundational modules:
  * `medi.data`: FHIR, HL7, DICOM support
  * `medi.compliance`: Basic regulatory frameworks
  * `medi.stats`: Statistical methods for healthcare
  * `medi.ai`: Initial AI capabilities
* Develop a basic IDE with visual analytics
* Test with synthetic datasets (FHIR, VCF, IoT streams)
* Target RISC-V (RV32) for IoT prototype implementation

### Milestone 1: Language Fundamentals (Month 3)
* Core syntax and parser
* Basic type system
* Standard library foundation

### Milestone 2: Healthcare Integration (Month 6)
* FHIR/HL7 integration
* Initial statistical functions
* Synthetic data testing

### Milestone 3: Developer Tools (Month 9)
* Basic IDE implementation
* Documentation system
* Early adopter program

## Phase 2: Pilot and Grants (12-18 Months)

The second phase expands capabilities and begins real-world testing:

* Pilot with universities/hospitals on trials, IoT, or AI use cases
* Expand library with new modules:
  * `medi.iot`: Real-time streaming capabilities
  * `medi.viz`: Advanced visualization
  * `medi.privacy`: Privacy-preserving analytics
* Enhance RISC-V support (RV64, vector extensions)
* Apply for grants (NIH, EU Horizon Europe, RISC-V Foundation)
* Grow community through social media and GitHub

### Milestone 4: Real-world Testing (Month 12)
* Initial pilot programs
* Bug fixes and performance improvements
* Community feedback integration

### Milestone 5: Enhanced Features (Month 15)
* Advanced RISC-V optimization
* Federated learning capabilities
* Expanded healthcare standards support

## Phase 3: Production Release (18-36 Months)

The final phase delivers a production-ready language:

* Complete the standard library:
  * Finalize `medi.ai` with production-ready models
  * Add `medi.ops` for hospital operations
* Launch plugin marketplace for extensions
* Optimize for:
  * Big data processing
  * Edge device deployment
  * Quantum computing readiness
* Launch formal training programs and certifications
* Integrate with major healthcare platforms:
  * Epic
  * Cerner
  * Cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)

### Milestone 6: Beta Release (Month 18)
* Feature complete standard library
* Comprehensive documentation
* Performance benchmarking

### Milestone 7: Production Release (Month 24)
* Stability improvements
* Enterprise deployment options
* Training materials and certifications

### Milestone 8: Ecosystem Growth (Month 36)
* Plugin marketplace
* Integration partners
* Academic and industry adoption
