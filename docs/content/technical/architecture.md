# Technical Architecture

Medi is built on a modern compiler infrastructure designed for healthcare-specific optimizations and features.

## High-Level Architecture

![Medi Architecture](../assets/images/architecture-placeholder.png)

The Medi language architecture consists of several key components:

1. **Frontend**: Parser, lexer, and abstract syntax tree (AST) generation
2. **Middle-end**: Type system, semantic analysis, and healthcare-specific optimizations
3. **Backend**: LLVM IR generation, optimization passes, and target code generation
4. **Runtime**: Standard library, memory management, and execution environment
5. **IDE & Tools**: Development environment, debugger, and profiler

## Compiler Infrastructure

Medi's compiler leverages LLVM for code generation and optimization:

* **Lexer & Parser**: Custom-built for healthcare-specific syntax
* **Type System**: Statically typed with type inference and healthcare data types
* **Optimizations**: Domain-specific optimizations for healthcare analytics
* **Code Generation**: 
  * x86-64, ARM, and RISC-V native code
  * WebAssembly for edge devices and browser deployment
  * CUDA/OpenCL for GPU acceleration

## Runtime System

The Medi runtime provides key services for healthcare applications:

* **Memory Management**: Hybrid approach with:
  * Low-pause garbage collection (like Go) for most operations
  * Rust-inspired manual control (`scope`) for low-latency IoT tasks
* **Concurrency**: Built-in support for:
  * Multi-threading (OpenMP-style)
  * Asynchronous operations (async/await)
  * Distributed computing (MPI/Spark integration)
* **Healthcare I/O**: Native parsers and generators for:
  * FHIR, HL7, DICOM
  * Genomic formats (FASTQ, VCF, BAM)
  * Medical imaging (NIfTI, DICOM)
  * Wearable data streams

## Standard Library

The standard library is organized into domain-specific modules:

* **medi.data**: FHIR, HL7, DICOM, VCF parsers and generators
* **medi.privacy**: Federated learning, differential privacy, encryption
* **medi.iot**: Real-time streaming and edge processing
* **medi.stats**: Statistical functions for trials, epidemiology, and biostatistics
* **medi.viz**: Interactive visualization and dashboarding
* **medi.compliance**: Regulatory frameworks and reporting
* **medi.ai**: Pre-trained models for diagnostics, predictions, and NLP
* **medi.ops**: Hospital operations optimization

## RISC-V Integration

Medi has special optimizations for RISC-V architecture:

* **Target Profiles**:
  * RV32IMAFDC for edge devices (wearables, portable diagnostics)
  * RV64GCV for servers (with vector extensions)
* **Custom Extensions**: Support for healthcare-specific instructions:
  * Genomic alignment and processing
  * Encryption for privacy preservation
  * Signal processing for medical imaging/time series
* **Optimizations**:
  * Low-power operation for edge devices
  * Vector processing for parallel analytics
  * Custom intrinsics for healthcare operations

## Security and Privacy

Security is a foundational concern in Medi's architecture:

* **Memory Safety**: Built-in protection against common vulnerabilities
* **Encryption**: Hardware-accelerated (where available) encryption for PHI
* **Access Control**: Fine-grained permissions system for data access
* **Audit Trails**: Automatic logging of sensitive operations
* **Differential Privacy**: Built-in mechanisms for privacy-preserving analytics

## IDE Integration

The Medi Studio IDE provides:

* **Visual Programming**: Drag-and-drop interface for non-programmers
* **Natural Language Interface**: Query and analysis using plain English
* **Code Completion**: Healthcare-aware suggestions
* **Compliance Checking**: Real-time validation against regulatory standards
* **Performance Profiling**: Optimization recommendations for healthcare tasks

## Deployment Options

Medi supports multiple deployment scenarios:

* **Traditional Compilation**: Native binaries for maximum performance
* **Just-in-Time (JIT)**: Dynamic compilation for interactive development
* **WebAssembly**: Browser and edge deployment
* **Container-based**: Docker/Kubernetes packaging for cloud deployment

## Future Extensibility

The architecture is designed for extensibility in emerging healthcare domains:

* **Quantum Computing**: Interface with quantum libraries (Qiskit, Cirq)
* **Neuromorphic Computing**: Support for neuromorphic hardware for AI tasks
* **Specialized Accelerators**: Integration with healthcare-specific hardware accelerators
