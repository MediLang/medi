## Diagnostics and Error Experience

Clinician-friendly diagnostics aim to provide clear messages, code frames, and actionable suggestions.

Example (illustrative):

```
error[E1002]: Type mismatch: expected Number, found String
 --> patient_risk.medi:12:17
  |
12|   let bmi = weight / "height";
  |                  ^^^^^^^^^^^ expected Number
  |
help: did you mean to use the numeric value?
      try: height.value  // or normalize units via ucum("180 cm")
note: future versions will suggest unit conversions and terminology lookups.
```

## Compliance & Safety

Planned compliance-by-design features and security posture:

- Regulatory scope: HIPAA, GDPR, 21 CFR Part 11; relevant ISO standards (ISO 13485, ISO 14971) [Planned]
- Controls: `regulate { ... }` blocks for compile-time checks, audit artifacts, and reporting [Planned]
- Data governance: PHI tagging, data minimization, consent/provenance (FHIR Consent, W3C PROV) [Planned]
- Security: OAuth2/OIDC (SMART on FHIR), mTLS, JWT, key management (KMS/HSM), secrets management [Planned]
- Observability: structured logs, FHIR AuditEvent/IHE ATNA alignment [Planned]

Disclaimer: This is not legal advice. Compliance features are under active design and implementation.

## Project Structure (Rust-Inspired)

This repository follows a Rust-style workspace structure:

- **Cargo.toml (workspace, in medi/)**: Defines the workspace and its member crates.
- **compiler/**: All Rust source files for the Medic compiler (not in a src/ subdirectory).
- **library/**: (Optional) Standard library crate(s) for Medic.
- **src/**: Reserved for future Medi language source code. Do not use for the compiler.
- **tests/**: Integration and system tests for the compiler and library.

### Building the Project

Run all builds from the medi/ directory root:
```sh
cargo build --workspace
```

### Running Tests

Run all tests for all crates:
```sh
cargo test --workspace
```

### Codegen CLI flags (x86-64)

When building with the LLVM backend feature, the `medic` CLI can emit x86-64 ELF object files and provides tuning flags for optimization, CPU, and features.

Basic usage:

```sh
medic --emit=x86_64 --out=program.o path/to/source.medi
```

Available flags:

- `--emit=x86_64`
- `--out=<file>`
- `--opt=0|1|2|3`  (0=None, 1=Less, 2=Default, 3=Aggressive)
- `--cpu=<name>`   (e.g., `haswell`)
- `--features=<csv>` (e.g., `+avx2,+sse4.2`)
- `--opt-pipeline=minimal|default` (selects a pass pipeline profile; default is `minimal`)

Examples:

```sh
# Default optimization/profile, generic x86-64
medic --emit=x86_64 --out=a.o input.medi

# Haswell with AVX2 at -O3 using the default (richer) pipeline
medic --emit=x86_64 --out=a.o \
  --opt=3 --cpu=haswell --features=+avx2,+sse4.2 \
  --opt-pipeline=default input.medi

# No optimization (useful for debugging generated code)
medic --emit=x86_64 --out=a.o --opt=0 input.medi
```

Notes:

- Register allocation is handled by LLVM’s x86 backend. The `--opt`, `--cpu`, and `--features` flags influence the pass pipeline and instruction selection, indirectly affecting RA.
- Object emission is performed by the x86-64 `TargetMachine`; the module’s data layout is configured from the target for correct alignment.

### Directory Purposes
- `compiler/`: Rust crate for the Medic compiler (`medic`). All Rust source files go directly here.
- `library/`: Rust crate(s) for the Medic standard library.
- `src/`: Reserved for future Medi language source code (not used for compiler).
- `tests/`: Integration/system tests (Rust or other frameworks).

This structure closely follows the Rust project layout inspiration.

## Developer Notes

### Quantity IR (experimental, dev-only)

Medi supports an experimental, feature-flagged Quantity IR that represents quantities as a concrete LLVM struct `%Quantity = { double value, i32 unit_id }`. This is disabled by default and intended for development and experiments with unit-aware codegen.

Enable and test (requires LLVM 15.x available and backend enabled):

```bash
# Build the backend crate with Quantity IR enabled
cargo build -p medic_codegen_llvm --features "llvm,quantity_ir"

# Or run feature-guarded tests that exercise the Quantity IR paths
cargo test -p tests -p medic_codegen_llvm --features "llvm,quantity_ir" -- --nocapture
```

Current semantics under `quantity_ir`:

- Quantities lower to `%Quantity` with per-module interned unit ids.
- Known unit conversions lower to a multiply on the value field and update the unit id.
- Unknown conversions call a runtime shim `medi_convert_q(%Quantity, i32 to_unit_id)`.
- Arithmetic is conservative for now:
  - Add/Sub require both operands to have the same unit (same unit id). Otherwise, convert explicitly first using `->`.
  - Mul/Div and comparisons on quantities are currently disallowed until dimensional analysis is introduced.

When `quantity_ir` is disabled (default), quantities lower to plain `f64` and unit metadata is tracked in side tables for type checking and diagnostics. Known conversions compile to `fmul` and unknown pairs call `medi_convert(double, i32, i32)`.
